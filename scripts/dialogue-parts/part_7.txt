 could that be the dog?
KRAMER: Well, get him to bark.
ELAINE: Yeah. Yeah. I'll know if he barks.
NEWMAN: All right. Bark.
ELAINE: Bark.
NEWMAN: Bark.
[At the theater]
SUSAN: Did you like it?
GEORGE: Yes, it was very, very good.
SUSAN: Oh, do you think he'll ever find her again?
GEORGE: Oh, I sure hope so.
JERRY: How about when Harrison Ford jumped out of that plane, and he was shooting back at them as he was falling?
FRIEND: What about that underwater escape?
JERRY: Oh, man!
[In the van]
KRAMER: Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it.
NEWMAN: ???????
ELAINE: You think we're far enough.
NEWMAN: We're practically to Monticello.
KRAMER: Yeah. This looks right. All right. Give me the dog. Okay, boy. This is it. This is your new home. Let go of my shirt. Come on. Let go of my shirt. This shirt is from Rudy's.
[Jerry's on the phone with his newly imprisoned buddy, Georgie.]
GEORGE: Hello?
JERRY: Hey, ??? is rerunning the Yankee game. You watching this?
GEORGE: They are?
SUSAN: GEORGE:, you coming to bed? I'm taping Mad About You.
GEORGE: Uh, yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
JERRY: What was that?
GEORGE: Uh, nothing. I got to go.
JERRY: Oh, Mattingly just singled .
GEORGE: You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal.
JERRY: I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand.
GEORGE: Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from.
JERRY: We come from the same place.
SUSAN: GEORGE:, I'm starting it.
GEORGE: I got to go.
[At the pooch's pad. ]
LADY: Roxy! Where have you been? We've been worried sick about you. What's this? Hmm. Rudy's.
[Elaine's bedroom - dog barking]
ELAINE: No! No! It's impossible. It's impossible.
[At Jerry's. ]
ELAINE: I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way.
JERRY: Very strange.
ELAINE: I know.
JERRY: So, tell me anyway. Who was the BIG mastermind?
ELAINE: Oh, I can't Jerry. 4I'm sworn to secrecy.
JERRY: All right. But then I can't tell you the BIG news.
ELAINE: News? What news?
JERRY: Sorry!
ELAINE: What? What?
JERRY: All right, Elaine but this is beyond news. This is like Pearl Harbor. Or the Kennedy assassination. It's like not even news. It's total shock.
ELAINE: Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please, please, please, please!
JERRY: George Costanza...
ELAINE: Yeah?
JERRY: Is getting married!
ELAINE: Get out!
[Outside Kramer's apartment]
KRAMER: Hi.
COP: You Cosmo Kramer?
KRAMER: Uh, yes. Yeah.
COP: You recognize this piece of fabric?
KRAMER: Oh, yeah, that's...
COP: What?
KRAMER: What?
COP: You're under arrest.
KRAMER: Arrest?
COP: I have a receipt for a rental car with your signature. Including a report with some damage to the rear seat. It seems the spring was so compressed it completely collapsed the right side..
JERRY: Newman.
[Cop at Newman's door]
NEWMAN: What took you so long?
[back of a Cop car]
KRAMER: Hey, what do you think they'll do to us?
NEWMAN: Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch.
ELAINE: I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?
(George and Susan in bed - MAY music)
[JERRY and ELAINE are walking down the street and Kramer is parking his car]
ELAINE: Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved.
JERRY: Really? What happened?
ELAINE: Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man.
JERRY: Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
ELAINE: Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on.
JERRY: That's great.
ELAINE: I know.
(Kramer crashing into parking spot)
JERRY: That looks pretty good.
ELAINE: He's in.
JERRY: Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.
ELAINE: What's to discuss?
JERRY: Come on! GEORGE: is getting married!
ELAINE: Is he happy?
[At the restaurant! GEORGE: is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride-to-be.]
GEORGE: I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?
SUSAN: Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.
GEORGE: Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?
SUSAN: Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken.
GEORGE: A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.
SUSAN: Can we change the subject, please?
GEORGE: Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?
SUSAN: No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it.
GEORGE: It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.
SUSAN: Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.
GEORGE: (To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.
[Jerry's]
JERRY: Yeah, he seems pretty happy.
ELAINE: Well, that's all that counts, I guess.
JERRY: What's the matter?
ELAINE: Oh, nothin'.
JERRY: Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.
ELAINE: Well, what do you want me to do?
JERRY: Well, at least have some reaction to it.
ELAINE: …Well, I don't.
JERRY: Maybe you're a little jealous.
ELAINE: Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?
JERRY: No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.
ELAINE: Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.
JERRY: Oh, yeah. Right.
ELAINE: Yeah, right.
JERRY: Lainy!
ELAINE: Jerry!
JERRY: You don't wanna get married?
ELAINE: Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.
JERRY: Oh, come on!
ELAINE: Oh, you come on.
JERRY: You're such...
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Oh, hey!
JERRY: Hey.
KRAMER: Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?
ELAINE: Oh, dear.
KRAMER: It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry?
JERRY: We're gonna change the system.
KRAMER: Yes!
ELAINE: Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.
[Outside Elaine's place]
ELAINE: Oh, hello, Rabbi Krischma.
RABBI: ELAINE:! Always a pleasure to see you.
ELAINE: Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.
RABBI: Elaine, often times in life there are problems, and just as often there are solutions.
ELAINE: Yeah, I suppose.
RABBI: Elaine, you don't seem yourself today. You seem, if I may say, troubled.
ELAINE: No, Rabbi, I'm not myself.
RABBI: Come upstairs. We'll have a talk.
[At Jerry's apartment. George trots in after his lunch with Kiki and Big Jer is kicking back with a paper.]
JERRY: Hey!
GEORGE: I want your honest opinion about something.
JERRY: Have I ever been less than forthright?
GEORGE: No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.
JERRY: Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?
GEORGE: All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea: Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor.
JERRY: Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.
GEORGE: It's good, right?
JERRY: I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.
GEORGE: You do?
JERRY: Yes, I do.
GEORGE: Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.
JERRY: Hmm.
GEORGE: Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, "Can we change the subject?"
JERRY: See, now that I don't care for.
GEORGE: Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?
JERRY: It should resolve of its own volition.
GEORGE: That's exactly what I said, except I used the word "momentum".
JERRY: Momentum - same thing.
GEORGE: Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?
JERRY: Yeah, I know.
GEORGE: Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.
JERRY: You're turning.
GEORGE: Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.
JERRY: If you need more time, you should have more time.
GEORGE: What, you think I could postpone it?
JERRY: Sure you can. Why not?
GEORGE: That's allowed? You're allowed to postpone it?
JERRY: I don't see why not.
GEORGE: So, I could do that?
JERRY: Sure, go ahead.
GEORGE: All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring.
JERRY: Spring. Of course.
GEORGE: Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.
JERRY: Beautiful.
GEORGE: She's not gonna like it.
JERRY: No, she's not.
GEORGE: You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.
JERRY: Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.
GEORGE: Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.
JERRY: Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hey, hey.
GEORGE: March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?
JERRY: Oh, all the way.
GEORGE: You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.
JERRY: Is that so?
JERRY: Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?
KRAMER: Definitely.
JERRY: You're kidding?
KRAMER: No, no, I would turn you in.
JERRY: You would turn me in?
KRAMER: Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it.
JERRY: I can't believe your a friend of mine.
KRAMER: What kind of person are you going around killing people?
JERRY: Well, I am sure I had a good reason.
KRAMER: Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?
JERRY: But you know me!
KRAMER: I thought I DID!
[Rabbi's apartment]
ELAINE: I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.
RABBI: Would you care for a snack of some kind? I have the Snackwells which are very popular but I think that sometimes with the so called fat free cookies people may overindulge forgetting they may be high in calories
ELAINE: Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .
RABBI: How wonderful.
ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.
RABBI: Doesn't it give you any joy to see your friend enter into this holiest of unions?
ELAINE: No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.
RABBI: You know, Elaine, very often we cannot see the forest for the trees.
ELAINE: Yeah, I don't know what that means.
RABBI: Well, for example, say there's a forest, . . .
ELAINE: You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.
RABBI: You know my temple has many single functions.
ELAINE: No, no, it's okay.
RABBI: My nephew Alex is someone who is also looking perhaps …
ELAINE: I don't think so.
RABBI: He owns a flower store. Very successful.
[Outside Coffee shop]
JERRY: So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.
KRAMER: Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
JERRY: Another Café Latte?
KRAMER: You better believe it.
KRAMER: Since when are you so trendy?
JERRY: Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Café Latte?
JERRY: I don't recall you drinking Café Latte.
KRAMER: I've been drinking Café Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.
JERRY: Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.
KRAMER: I've always wanted to see this.
JERRY: You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.
KRAMER: Well, yeah, lets do it uh?
JERRY: Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.
JERRY: Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
KRAMER: Maybe I will.
[George's]
GEORGE: Hi,
SUSAN: How was your day?
GEORGE: Good, good day. How was your day?
SUSAN: Mine was okay. So what's goin' on?
GEORGE: Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.
SUSAN: Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night.
GEORGE: The Lowers, really?
SUSAN: You don't want to go?
GEORGE: No, I want to go.
SUSAN: So what did Jerry have to say?
GEORGE: Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!
SUSAN: Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me.
GEORGE: Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?
SUSAN: Yeah.
GEORGE: Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.
SUSAN: What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?
GEORGE: No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the …
SUSAN: If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. (crying) Say so.
GEORGE: Still marry , still marry.
SUSAN: You don't love me.
GEORGE: Sstill love. Still love.
SUSAN: My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake.
GEORGE: No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I …It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really.
SUSAN: Are you sure?
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.
[Monk's]
JERRY: Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.
GEORGE: How did you know that?
JERRY: I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.
GEORGE: I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.
JERRY: tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.
GEORGE: You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.
JERRY: Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.
GEORGE: I didn't have any sex.
JERRY: You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.
GEORGE: I didn't have make-up sex.
JERRY: In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.
GEORGE: Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening!
WOMAN: (crying)
MAN: I can tell you're very upset but I'm sorry I'm not goin'
GEORGE: Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.
MAN: Are you going to eat thoise fries?
GEORGE: This is amazing. (George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand) Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better (to woman)
JERRY: . . . Poor bastard.
[Outside Elaine's]
JERRY: Good evening, Rabbi.
RABBI: Good evening. And how does this evening find you?
JERRY: Well, Rabbi, well.
RABBI: I trust you are here to see your friend, Elaine.
JERRY: Yeah, that's right.
RABBI: I hope she's feeling better.
JERRY: What do you mean?
RABBI: She didn't tell you?
JERRY: No.
RABBI: Well it seems the engagement of her ffriend George has left her feeling bitter and hostile.
JERRY: is that so?
RABBI: Yes, in fact she told me that she wishes she was the one getting married.
JERRY: Really?
RABBI: She came off as pretty desperate.
JERRY: I didn't know any of this.
RABBI: Apparently she doesn't think much of this George fellow either. I recall the word loser peppered throughout her conversation.
JERRY: Hum, well it all comes as news to me.
[George's apartment]
GEORGE: (enters) Hi.
SUSAN: Hi, how was your day?
GEORGE: Good, good day. How was your day?
SUSAN: Ah, it was okay. What's going on?
GEORGE: Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?
SUSAN: Yeah, sure.
GEORGE: You see this is the thing. . . . (crying) I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, (cry)
SUSAN: George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is what you want.
GEORGE: Yeah?
SUSAN: Oh, don't worry your head. Of course.
GEORGE: All right. (smiles behind her back)
[Elaine's]
ELAINE: I've got that magazine article for you.
JERRY: You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.
ELAINE: Are you
JERRY: Understand you had a little talk with him too.
ELAINE: Yeah, talked earlier.
JERRY: Yes I know, I know.
ELAINE:. . . What does that mean?
JERRY: Nothing, nothing.
ELAINE: He didn't mention . . .
JERRY: Yes he did.
ELAINE: He told you about our conversation?
JERRY: We had quite a little chat.
ELAINE: He told you about . . .
JERRY: Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.
ELAINE: He told you all that? How could he?
JERRY: It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.
ELAINE: Can he do that?
JERRY: He did it.
ELAINE: But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?
JERRY: That's what's so fascinating.
(Movie line)
JERRY: You better finish your little café latte there. They won't let you in with it.
KRAMER: Why not?
JERRY: Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
KRAMER: Well that's stupid
JERRY: That's the rule.
KRAMER: Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.
(Kramer puts coffee cup into his pants)
[Rabbi's apartment]
RABBI: Oh, Elaine. Come in. Come in. So nice to see you again.
ELAINE: Yeah…
RABBI: Can I offere you some Kasha Varnishkas?
ELAINE: No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?
RABBI: Was that a problem for you?
ELAINE: Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?
RABBI: Well, let's see? I seem to recall a conversation with Mrs. Winston in 1F.
ELAINE: Mrs. Winston?
RABBI: Yes, we were waiting for our mail to arrive and I happened to mention to her how you felt that it was never going "to happen" for you.
ELAINE: What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?
RABBI: Don Ramsey?
ELAINE: You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.
RABBI: Oh him! Well this morning I found myself in the elevator with him…
ELAINE: my god, you didn't.
(Movie theatre)
JERRY: Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me
KRAMER: Oh, yow, oow Ah!
USHER: Hey, hey, what's going on? What just happened here?
KRAMER: Nothing Nothing.
USHER: Whatya got? One of those Café Latte's in your shirt?
KRAMER: I don't have anything. Ask him.
(Jerry makes a silent drink gesture)
USHER: All right, come on Coffee Boy, bring it out.
KRAMER: What?!
USHER: Here you go.
KRAMER: Ow
(Kramer leaves)
[Jerry's apartment]
ELAINE: But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.
JERRY: Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.
ELAINE: You didn't say this to George, did you?
JERRY: No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?
ELAINE: Yeah that! So, . . .
(George enters)
GEORGE: Hey oh.
ELAINE: GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.
GEORGE: Alright, thanks a lot.
ELAINE: Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.
(Gives George a kiss)
GEORGE: Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...
ELAINE: Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.
GEORGE: Well, I guess I'm getting older.
ELAINE: Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan.
GEORGE: Yeah.
ELAINE: My most, just heartfelt congratulations.
GEORGE: Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.
ELAINE: Yes! Yes, yes. Sure.
GEORGE: Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.
ELAINE: Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.
GEORGE: Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?
JERRY: Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh…
GEORGE: Nope. I wept like a baby.
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.
JERRY: You cried?
GEORGE: I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.
JERRY, GEORGE, & KRAMER: Hey!
JERRY: Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.
KRAMER: Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.
JERRY: Suing? What for?
KRAMER: The coffee was too hot.
JERRY: It's supposed to be hot.
KRAMER: Not THAT hot.
[At George's home. He and Susan are in bed watching TV]
RABBI: (On TV) The prophet Isaah tells us without friends our lives are empty and meaningless.
GEORGE: Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.
RABBI: A young lady I know, let's call her Elaine, happened to find herself overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, let's call him George. She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and that she was the one who deserved to be married first. She also happened to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute while you're engaged is considered cheating. His feeling was they're never going to see each other again so what's the difference. But that is a subject for another sermon. Now, I'd like to close with a psalm.
[Setting: Booth at Monk's Cafe]
GEORGE: And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.
ELAINE: I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.
GEORGE: Ya know, I was just a little surprised.
JERRY: Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?
GEORGE: What about all the loser stuff?
ELAINE: I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said "I've never seen you looser".
JERRY: I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.
GEORGE: (Gets up to leave) Well, scintillating as always.
JERRY: Where you going?
GEORGE: I'm going shopping with Susan.
ELAINE: What kind of shopping?
GEORGE: Clothes shopping.
ELAINE: Where are you going?
GEORGE: Ross'.
ELAINE: Oh that's a nice store.
GEORGE: Yeah, it's her uncle's.
JERRY: Discount?
GEORGE: (As he leaves) One would hope.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jackie Child's Office]
(Kramer is sitting across from Jackie)
KRAMER: So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off and bought this cafe latte.
JACKIE: (Agreeing) Hm Hm. Oh what is that like Italian coffee?
KRAMER: Yeah that's right.
JACKIE: Half milk, half coffee?
KRAMER: Yeah.
JACKIE: Hm Hm. You take a sip?
KRAMER: Yes I did.
JACKIE: Now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? Were you able to sip it in your normal fashion?
KRAMER: No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.
JACKIE: Hm Hm. All right, all right. You take big sips?
KRAMER: Well I think I take a normal sip.
JACKIE: O.K. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then what happened?
KRAMER: Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in.
JACKIE: Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee.
KRAMER: Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?
JACKIE: Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's gonna be a problem for them. This a clear violation of your rights as a consumer. It's an infringement on your constitutional rights. It's outrageous, egregious, preposterous.
KRAMER: It's definitely preposterous.
JACKIE: So. Then what happened?
KRAMER: Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.
JACKIE: Was there a top on it?
KRAMER: Yeah.
JACKIE: Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you?
KRAMER: No. They put the top on.
JACKIE: And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you?
(Kramer motions that he did not make the top)
JACKIE: (To secretary over intercom) Suzie. I want you to go down to Java World. Get me a cafe latte with a top. (To Kramer) We're gonna run some test on that top. Have you been to the doctor?
KRAMER: Ah No no, I haven't.
JACKIE: (To secretary over intercom) Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer here. Tell him it's from me.
KRAMER: So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles.
JACKIE: Jackie.
KRAMER: Jackie. I mean, we have a chance?
JACKIE: Do we have a chance? You get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you gonna walk outta there a rich man.

[Setting: Ross' clothing store]
(Susan is holding a bright red shirt up to George)
GEORGE: I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.
SUSAN: Well you could use a little flash.
GEORGE: All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now.
SUSAN: Name one.
MR ROSS: So, you find anything?
SUSAN: Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned.
MR ROSS: I'm going on vacation to Costa Rica. Maybe I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
SUSAN: O.K.
SALESMAN: Excuse me Mr Ross.
(George notices the security guard standing near the front door)
GEORGE: See now this I don't get.
SUSAN: What?
GEORGE: The security guard.
SUSAN: What about him?
GEORGE: Why does he have to stand?
SUSAN: Because he's a security guard.
GEORGE: But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day? That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle.
SUSAN: George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him.
GEORGE: Aren't you concerned about the security guard?
SUSAN: Not really. (Walks away)
GEORGE: (Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.
SUSAN: All right George. (She puts the red shirt up to him again) What do you think?
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Elaine and Jerry are in Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY: So ah, what did you do last night?
ELAINE: Nothing.
JERRY: I know nothing, but what did you actually do?
ELAINE: Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.
JERRY: Wow. That really is nothing.
ELAINE: I told ya.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
ELAINE: Hey.
JERRY: What are you all dressed up for?
KRAMER: Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
JERRY: Oh yeah, how's that looking?
KRAMER: Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury, (in a very high voice) I'm gonna be a rich man.
ELAINE: That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.
KRAMER: Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.
JERRY: Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.
KRAMER: Oh I can be quite litigious.
ELAINE: What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.
KRAMER: Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.
ELAINE: (Mocking) Jackie says the top was faulty.
(Sounds of knocking in the background on Kramer's door)
KRAMER: Hey Maestro!
MAESTRO: Ah, Kramer.
KRAMER: I'm in here. How's it going.
MAESTRO: Fine.
JERRY: Hi Bob.
(Kramer coughs purposely and motions toward maestro with his head)
JERRY: (Apologetically) Oh, I'm sorry. Maestro.
KRAMER: Well, this is a surprise ha?
MAESTRO: I just wanted to drop off this Chinese balm for your burns. It's supposed to be great stuff. It's all herbal.
KRAMER: Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro?
MAESTRO: It's nothing.
KRAMER: Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while.
MAESTRO: Oh yeah, I've been at my house in Tuscany.
KRAMER: Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.
JERRY: I hear it's ah beautiful there.
MAESTRO: Well if you're thinking of getting a place there don't bother. There's really nothing available.
JERRY: (Surprised) Huh?
(Elaine enters from bathroom)
MAESTRO: (Seeing Elaine) Oh!
ELAINE: Hello.
MAESTRO: Well Hello. And who might you be?
ELAINE: I might be Elaine.
JERRY: This is a, Bob Cobb.
KRAMER: Maestro.
ELAINE: Oh, Maestro.
MAESTRO: It is my very great pleasure. (Kisses Elaine's hand)
ELAINE: Enchante.
MAESTRO AND ELAINE (Simultaneously): Well I have to be going.
ELAINE: Jinx buy me a coke.
MAESTRO: Oh. Love it when that happeneds.
ELAINE: I know I know. That is so ahh ......
MAESTRO: Coincidental.
ELAINE: Yeah, thanks. O.K. Bye you guys.
MAESTRO: Ciao.
(Elaine and Maestro leave)
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.
(Kramer shuts the door and stares at Jerry)
KRAMER: You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings.
JERRY: Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?
KRAMER: That's right.
JERRY: Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.
KRAMER: Why?
JERRY: Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
KRAMER: Jerry he's a conductor.
JERRY: Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.
KRAMER: Well, he's still a conductor.
JERRY: Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.
KRAMER: Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'.
(Kramer makes like a conductor and makes a classic Kramer sound)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Monks Cafe. George and Jerry are sitting across from each other]
JERRY: New shirt?
GEORGE: Yeah. You like it.
JERRY: No, not particularly.
GEORGE: Why, the color?
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: Too flashy?
JERRY: Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?
GEORGE: (Obviously lying) No.
JERRY: (Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here.
GEORGE: Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?
JERRY: No.
GEORGE: See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering.
JERRY: Are you sensing anything right now?
GEORGE: Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?
JERRY: Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.
GEORGE: What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch. (stands up) Criminals. Boom. I'm up. (pretends he's shooting) Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!
JERRY: Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
GEORGE: Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk with him.
JERRY: I know you will.
(Kramer enters and sits next to Jerry)
KRAMER: Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called.
GEORGE: Who?
JERRY: His lawyer.
KRAMER: Yeah, Java World wants to settle.
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: Yeah, I'm gonna be rich.
JERRY: Why are they settling?
KRAMER: Cause their afraid of bad publicity.
JERRY: All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?
KRAMER: Yeah that's right.
GEORGE: (Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Restaurant. Maestro and Elaine are talking)
MAESTRO: And then about four years ago I was on holiday in Tuscany.
ELAINE: Uh ha.
MAESTRO: And I fell in love with this house.
(Waiter approaches)
WAITER: Are you ready to order?
ELAINE: Oh God. What are you getting Bob?
(Maestro looks at Elaine with an annoyed look on his face)
MAESTRO: Good question. (to waiter) We'll need a few minutes.
(Maestro puts his head in his hand. He is visibly upset)
MAESTRO: You know, I'm sorry but, I didn't mention it earlier but actually I preferred to be called Maestro.
ELAINE: Excuse me?
MAESTRO: Well, ya know I am a conductor.
ELAINE: Yeah, so?
MAESTRO: Oh I suppose it's O.K. for Leonard Burnstein to be called Maestro because he conducted the New York Philharmonic. So he gets to be called Maestro and I don't.
ELAINE: Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny.
MAESTRO: I happen to know for a fact, that he was called Maestro in social situations. I once saw him at a bar and someone came up to him and said "Hello Maestro, how about a beer". O.K. So that's a fact.
ELAINE: Maestro huh? O.K. (laughing)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment. Jerry is at the refrigerator getting orange juice.]
(Kramer enters frantically)
KRAMER: Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look.(shows Jerry the burn area).
JERRY: What do you mean?
KRAMER: Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it healed it.
JERRY: So?
KRAMER: So? My lawsuit. I'm finished.
JERRY: I thought they wanted to settle.
KRAMER: Well what happens if they want to see it?
JERRY: Then you're in a lot of trouble.
KRAMER: Yeah!!
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Ross' clothing store. Guard is standing near entrance. George enters.]
GEORGE: (To guard) Tired?
GUARD: No.
GEORGE: How come uh, no chair?
GUARD: What?
GEORGE: I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair.
GUARD: I don't need a chair.
GEORGE: No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?
GUARD: Nope.
GEORGE: Would you like a chair?
GUARD: I suppose if they gave me one I'd sit down.
GEORGE: Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?
GUARD: Obviously I'd rather sit than stand, if that's what your asking.
GEORGE: That's exactly my point.
GUARD: Well who wouldn't?
GEORGE: Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down. (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Back seat of a cab. Jackie and Kramer]
JACKIE: You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you to put the balm on. Why'd you put the balm on? You haven't even been to see the doctor. If your gonna put a balm on, let a doctor put a balm on.
KRAMER: I guess I screwed up huh Jackie?
JACKIE: Your damn right you screwed up. Where the hell did you get that damm balm anyway?
KRAMER: The Maestro.
JACKIE: The who? What are you talking about Maestro?
KRAMER: My friend he's a conductor.
JACKIE: Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it?
KRAMER: Well my stomach was burning.
JACKIE: I tell you what this is. This is a public humiliation.
KRAMER: Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.
JACKIE: Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didn't you read the instructions?
KRAMER: Well I ...
JACKIE: (interrupts) No one can tell what a balm's gonna do. They're unpredictable.
KRAMER: I'm sorry Jackie.
JACKIE: (To cab driver) Pull over here driver this is it.
KRAMER: (Motions with his head) Yeah, get over.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Elaine and Jerry walking on the sidewalk in NYC]
JERRY: Did you have a good time?
ELAINE: Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'.
JERRY: (Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.
ELAINE: Really?
JERRY: So what about the "Maestro" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.
ELAINE: Yeah, I called him Maestro.
JERRY: You didn't mind?
ELAINE: Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.
JERRY: O.K. from now on I want you to call me "Jerry the Great".
ELAINE: I am not calling you "Jerry the Great".
JERRY: Why not you call him Maestro.
ELAINE: He is a Maestro.
JERRY: Well, I'm great.
ELAINE: So you say.
JERRY: What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?
ELAINE: Yeah. (bragging) I'm invited.
JERRY: You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there.
ELAINE: Why?
JERRY: I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
ELAINE: Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.
JERRY: In all of Tuscany? I wonder.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Office of a Java World building]
MR STAR: I say we offer him $50,000 that's it, take it or leave it.
MR BURNS: How do we know how severe the burns are? Why don't we have him examined by a doctor.
MS. JORDAN: Listen, the faster we dispose of this the better. This thing gets into the paper it will kill us.
MR STAR: All right, we'll start at 50,000 and free coffee at all of our stores.
(Secretary beeps)
MR STAR: (Answering secretary) Yes?
(Heard over the speaker)
SECRETARY: Mr. Chiles and Mr. Kramer are here.
(To intercom)
MR STAR: Send them in.
(Mr. Star opens door to let Jackie and Kramer in)
MR STAR: Gentleman.
(Kramer and Jackie enter Mr. Star's office)
MR STAR: Gentleman come in. Now we don't want to take up much of your time. Let's make this short and sweet. We're prepared to offer you all the free coffee you want in any of our stores throughout North America and Europe, Plus..
KRAMER: (Interrupting) I'LL TAKE IT!!
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jackie and Kramer in the back of a cab]
JACKIE: I'll take it? Who told you to take it? Did I tell you to take it?
KRAMER: No.
JACKIE: I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't there.
KRAMER: Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.
JACKIE: Free coffee?
KRAMER: Yeah.
JACKIE: I don't want free coffee. It's not hard to get coffee. I can get my own
damn coffee. I wanted to hear what came after that "Plus".
KRAMER: Well I didn't hear any Plus.
JACKIE: 20 years practicing law I've never experienced anything like this.
(Kramer spots a Java World)
KRAMER: Look, Java World. (To cabbie) Hey listen I'm gonna get out here. I'm gonna get myself a free cafe latte.
(Kramer tramples over Jackie to get out of the cab)

[Setting: Jerry and Elaine are walking down the street and hear music approaching]
ELAINE: Hey. Hi Maestro.
(Maestro makes like a conductor waiving his hands. Elaine joins in to finish the song)
MAESTRO: Beethoven's 7th.
ELAINE: Yeah.
JERRY: Hey you know we were just talking about you.
MAESTRO: Oh yeah?
JERRY: Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?
MAESTRO: You didn't find one, did you?
JERRY: No. I'm not really looking.
MAESTRO: Nor should you.
JERRY: So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?
MAESTRO: The houses are passed down from generation to generation, it's very hard.
JERRY: I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?
MAESTRO: It's booked solid!
ELAINE: It's BOOKED Jerry!
JERRY: How'd you get yours?
MAESTRO: Got lucky. Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride, I was about to pop in some Verdi.
(Elaine starts to sing in Italian. Maestro and Elaine drive away)
JERRY: Maybe I'll check out France.
(George walks towards Jerry)
JERRY: Hey George, do you believe this guy?
GEORGE: Who?
JERRY: Bob Cobb.
GEORGE: Bob Cobb?
JERRY: You know, the Maestro.
GEORGE: Oh I missed the Maestro?
JERRY: Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.
GEORGE: Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?
JERRY: No.
GEORGE: So what do you care?
(George walks away leaving Jerry standing there by himself)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Monk's cafe. George and Jerry are sitting at the booth]
JERRY: I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.
GEORGE: Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is?
JERRY: I have no idea.
GEORGE: It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.
JERRY: Oh, no way it's that big.
GEORGE: It's a big region.
JERRY: Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?
GEORGE: I don't know why I bother even talking to you.
JERRY: Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.
GEORGE: All right.
(George and Jerry hold there arms up in a truce)
GEORGE: So I spoke to the security guard.
JERRY: Yeah and?
GEORGE: Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit.
JERRY: So are you gonna get him a chair?
GEORGE: Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.
JERRY: Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without.
GEORGE: Oh I think I'd go for the back.
JERRY: Swivel?
GEORGE: I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those.
JERRY: I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect.
GEORGE: You mean one of those vinyl things?
JERRY: Yes.
GEORGE: Vinyl yeah, maybe.
JERRY: How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a minute. Poppy's from Tuscany. I'm gonna go call him.
(Jerry leaves the booth headed for the phone in the back of the cafe)
GEORGE: Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.

[Setting: On the street in the city, George and Jerry are talking]
JERRY: Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy.
GEORGE: What do you think about a rocking chair?
(Camera shifts to inside a Java World and Kramer is exiting at the door)
KRAMER: (Speaking very fast and fidgety) You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here. If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble.
(Kramer exits and runs into Jerry and George)
JERRY: Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?
KRAMER: Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.
JERRY: That's it?
KRAMER: That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem. Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure.
JERRY: You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.
KRAMER: Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell.
JERRY: You're racing!
KRAMER: Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye.

(George motions for the clerk to approach him)
GEORGE: What's your name?
CLERK: Evan Fayne.
GEORGE: I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.
CLERK: I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
GEORGE: Innocent mistake.
(George gives the chair to the security guard)
GEORGE: Well, here you go. What do you think?
GUARD: Mr. Ross says this is O.K.?
GEORGE: Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out.

GIGGIO: Si, the house in Tuscana.
JERRY: Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?
GIGGIO: Si. Two million lira. You give me the check.
JERRY: I didn't actually want to rent it.
GIGGIO: The keys, here are the keys. You give me the check. Two million lira. Seventeen hundred Americana. Molto generoso.
(A man approaches Mr. Giggio and whispers in his ear.)
GIGGIO: (To the man) Si, Si.
(Jerry watches the man walk away and appears to be very frightened)
JERRY: So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was just wondering if there were houses there to rent.
GIGGIO: Si. (hods up the keys) Thissa one!. Capiche?

ELAINE: It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away.
MAESTRO: I told you, it's paradise.
ELAINE: You're right Maestro.
(The sound of a car horn is heard in the background. A cab driver is yelling in Italian. Elaine and Maestro go to the window on the other side of the room to see what is going on. We see the cab.)
KRAMER: Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out.
(Jerry falls out of the back seat of the cab.)
JERRY: You didn't have to push me.
KRAMER: I didn't push you. How much did you pay that guy?
JERRY: 75,000 lira.
KRAMER: 75,000 lira? Are you out of your mind?
JERRY: Kramer you don't under the conversion rate.
KRAMER: Oh, conversion rate, oh.

[Elaine's bedroom - phone rings]
ELAINE: Hello
JAMES: This is your wake up service. It's 7:15
ELAINE: Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.
JAMES: Hot date last night?
ELAINE: I wish.
JAMES: A woman with a sexy voice like yours its hard to believe your waking up alone.
ELAINE: Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person.
JAMES: Call me James.
ELAINE: Oh, all right, James. He he he
[Monks]
GEORGE: Your wake up guy asked you out?
ELAINE: Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,
JERRY: I don't know. Blind date?
ELAINE: What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.
JERRY: Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.
ELAINE: At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.
JERRY: I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.
ELAINE: Ah, . . .
GEORGE: Now you're off on a topic.
JERRY: You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.
ELAINE: Uh hu.
JERRY: Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.
GEORGE: You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.
ELAINE: I think she'd figure it out.
(waitress places plates on the table)
ELAINE: What? What is this?
JERRY: Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.
ELAINE: Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?
JERRY: A healthy person.
GEORGE: ( rubbing his eye) Ow, Ow you squirted me.
JERRY: Oh, sorry
GEORGE: Boy, it stings.
[Yankee Stadium]
WILHELM: George, have you seen Morgan?
GEORGE: No.
WILHELM: He's been coming in late all week. Is there something wrong?
GEORGE: No, not that I know of. (winks)
WILHELM: Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's a problem with Morgan you can tell me.
GEORGE: Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)
WILHELM: I understand.
[Jerry's apartment]
JERRY: I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.
ELAINE: I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.
JERRY: You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?
ELAINE: I think I can tell.
JERRY: Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?
ELAINE: Twenty-five percent.
JERRY: Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.
ELAINE: You're way off.
JERRY: Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.
ELAINE: So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?
JERRY: UNDATEABLE!
ELAINE: Then how are all these people getting together?
JERRY: Alcohol.
ELAINE: (to George who is winking) What is your problem?
GEORGE: No problem here.
ELAINE: You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.
GEORGE: I had no idea.
ELAINE: Right there. Right there. You just did it again.
GEORGE: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.
ELAINE: You're eye still hurts?
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.
JERRY: Pulp couldn't make it across the table.
GEORGE: Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?
JERRY: Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.
GEORGE: Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.
ELAINE: What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?
GEORGE: Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hi guys.
JERRY: Hi,
KRAMER: Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's signature?
GEORGE: Yeah.
KRAMER: And Buck Showalter's?
GEORGE: It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office.
KRAMER: Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.
GEORGE: Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. (winks)
KRAMER: No, of course not. (winks back)
[Sports Memorabilia Shop]
KRAMER: You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.
STEINBRENNER: I don't know. An envelope doesn't really cut it.
KRAMER: Why?
STEINBRENNER: What is this? A birthday card. Ha ha . . . signed by the ENTIRE Yankee organization! . . . This could be worth something.
[Yankee Stadium]
GEORGE: Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan?
MORGAN: Hello.
MORGAN: Oh, by the way, have you got that birthday card?
GEORGE: Birthday card?
MORGAN: Mr. Steinbrenner's birthday card. Wilhem said you had it for me to sign.
GEORGE: Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch.
MORGAN: Fine. I'll be back after my massage.
GEORGE: Of course. Your massage. (winks) Enjoy your massage. (winks)
[Monk's - Elaine sitting alone]
ELAINE: Hello.
James: Elaine?
ELAINE: James! Ah, ha, Hello! Phew!
[Old Homestead Steak House]
HOLLY: I can't believe you've never taken anybody here before.
JERRY: Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.
HOLLY: . . . You don't eat meat? Are you one of those. . .
JERRY: Well, no, I'm not one of those.
HOLLY: When we were little girls Grandma Memma would take us to a matinee and then dinner here.
JERRY: Grandma Memma?
HOLLY: Elaine must have mentioned Grandma Memma.
JERRY: No, I think I would have remembered Memma.
HOLLY: Oh well, that's typical. Elaine never liked Grandma Memma.
WAITER: Ready?
HOLLY: I'll have the porterhouse medium rare, baked potato with sour cream,
JERRY: What do you recommend besides the steak?
WAITER: The lamb chops are good.
JERRY: Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?
WAITER: It's a full bird. Stuffed with ham, topped with gorganzola.
JERRY: You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.
WAITER: . . . Thank you.
JERRY: (mind's voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?
[Outside of Monk's - James unties his dogs]
JAMES: Hey you, hey you.
ELAINE: Oh, uh, ha, you've got dogs?
JAMES: Yeah, you know, when you live alone, you're dogs are all you have. Do you like dogs?
ELAINE: (mind's voice from - … ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT !
ELAINE: Dogs. Oh I love dogs.
JAMES: Boys, this is Elaine. . . . Sorry, they're usually very friendly. Hey!
[Yankee Stadium]
GEORGE: Hey, Mr. Morgan how was your massage?
MORGAN: I had to cancel it. For some reason my wife got it into her head that it was more than just a massage.
GEORGE: Really?
MORGAN: Yeah, we had this big fight at lunch it looks like tonight I will be sleeping on the couch.
GEORGE: Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again.
MORGAN: I know. Somebody around here has been giving Wilhelm the impression that I have been slacking off.
GEORGE: Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing.
MORGAN: Costanza, you may be my only friend around here. By the way, you got that birthday card?
GEORGE: Ah, not yet.
MORGAN: Just make sure Steinbrenner doesn't get it until I sign it.
GEORGE: Yes sir!
[Jerry's apartment]
ELAINE: I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.
JERRY: Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?
ELAINE: Huh huh.
JERRY: Did she mention anything about our lunch?
ELAINE: Uh, kind of.
JERRY: What do you mean, "kind of."?
ELAINE: I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man.
JERRY: What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't respect salad eaters.
ELAINE: You got that right.
JERRY: But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?
ELAINE: Um uh.
JERRY: What is she making?
ELAINE: I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come.
JERRY: Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery.
(Kramer's door - George knocks)
KRAMER: Ah, Mr. Weatherbee.
GEORGE: You got the Yankee envelope?
KRAMER: Sure do.
GEORGE: oh,
KRAMER: Here you go.
GEORGE: Hey, he,
KRAMER: You'll be pleased to see what's inside.
GEORGE: What is this?
KRAMER: You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed birthday card that was inside.
GEORGE: Who told you to sell the card?
KRAMER: You did.
GEORGE: No I didn't!
KRAMER: No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. (winks)
GEORGE: I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.
KRAMER: Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the hospital .
GEORGE: Well get it back! It's very important. (winks)
KRAMER: Look, do you want me to get it back or not?
GEORGE: (holds eyes wide open) Get it back!
[Holly's apartment]
ELAINE: Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?
HOLLY: They're grandma Memma's.
ELAINE: Oh, I don't remember them.
HOLLY: Oh, you wouldn't. She only used them on special occasions.
ELAINE: Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?
HOLLY: Everybody like mutton?
JERRY: Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off.
[Hospital room]
KRAMER: That you Bobby?
BOBBY: huh
KRAMER: Well, I heard that you have a very uh, special birthday card .with all the Yankee autographs on it.
BOBBY: Sure do. Mister.
KRAMER: Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person at the New York Yankees needed this card back.
BOBBY: Oh, no. I'd never part with this card for anything in the world.
KRAMER: Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee.
BOBBY: Paul O'Neill.
KRAMER: All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow, just for you.
BOBBY: Would he? Paul O'Neill would do that?
KRAMER: For you he would.
BOBBY: Would he hit two home runs?
KRAMER: Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something for me.
BOBBY: I know. Get out of this bed one day and walk again.
KRAMER: Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card.
[Holly's apartment]
ELAINE: What about this candelabra?
HOLLY: Yeah, that was grandma Memma's also. She bought it on her trip to Europe in 1936. Jerry, I'm thrilled you like my mutton. I was afrais you only ate . . . salad.
JERRY: Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton.
HOLLY: That is so funny. Did you just make that up?
JERRY: I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket)
HOLLY: That was in Grandma's study.
ELAINE: What did you do, ransack the place after she died?
JERRY: This is some FINE mutton.
ELAINE: I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?
JERRY: Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)
ELAINE: It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton.
[On the street - dogs following Elaine]
ELAINE: Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what you hear.
[Holly's]
HOLLY: Where are the napkins?
JERRY: What?
HOLLY: Grandma Memma's napkins. There's two missing. Elaine took them didn't she?
JERRY: I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?
HOLLY: You heard her. She coveted them. I bet she took them just to spite me. She's probably having a good laugh about it right now.
[On the street dogs chasing Elaine]
ELAINE: Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a
[James' apartment]
JERRY: Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?
ELAINE: Did you do with the dogs?
JERRY: Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on?
ELAINE: These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.
JERRY: Why were dogs chasing you?
ELAINE: They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.
JERRY: I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.
ELAINE: We'll have to sleep head to toe.
JERRY: Head to toe?
ELAINE: Head to toe.
[The next morning at James']
ELAINE: Hey, wake up. It's 8:30 you were supposed to walk me up at 7:15.
JERRY: I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.
ELAINE: You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?
JERRY: I'll make them later. Uh.
(Mr. Morgan's - he's asleep on the couch)
[Yankee Stadium - George's office]
WILHELM: Have you seen Morgan?
GEORGE: He's not here?
WILHELM: No, He's late.
GEORGE: It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.
WILHELM: Now, George, you don't have to cover for him any more. He's going to be gone soon and I'm going to recommend you for his job.
GEORGE: . . . gone?
[Monk's]
JERRY: It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.
GEORGE: I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.
ELAINE: Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.
GEORGE: Napkins?
ELAINE: I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.
JERRY: Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.
ELAINE: They were?
JERRY: Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.
ELAINE: Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.
GEORGE: What exactly is mutton?
JERRY: I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?
ELAINE: Oh, I must have left it at Jame's
JERRY: You spent the night at James's? Did we?
ELAINE: Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.
JERRY: Reversed positions?
ELAINE: Yeah, you know, head to toe.
JERRY: So what your genitals are still lined up.
ELAINE: No, because I slept with my back to him.
(long pause - no comment from the guys)
[Yankee Stadium]
KRAMER: Mr. O'Neill?
O'NEILL: Yeah.
KRAMER: Yeah, uh, look, you don't know me.
O'NEILL: I can give you an autograph there, but my pen's kind of screwed up. You'd only like half a "P" or something.
KRAMER: No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits.
O'NEILL: Sure, I could help you there.
KRAMER: Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs.
O'NEILL: Say what?
KRAMER: You know, Klick!. A couple of dingers.
O'NEILL: You promised a kid in the hospital that I would hit two home runs?
KRAMER: Yeah, well, no good?
O'NEILL: Yeah. That's no good. It's terrible. You don't hit home runs like that. It's hard to hit home runs. And where the heck did you get two from?
KRAMER: Two is better than one.
O'NEILL: That, that's ridiculous. I'm not a home run hitter.
KRAMER: Well, Babe Ruth did it.
O'NEILL: He did not.
KRAMER: Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?
O'NEILL: I'm not calling him a liar but he was not stupid enough to promise two.
KRAMER: Well, maybe I did overextend myself.
O'NEILL: How the heck did you get in here anyway?
[James']
JAMES: (on phone) Oh, hi Elaine. You know I lost all of my 6:30 clients because of you. . . . Yeah, well why did you have to stick your feet in my face? . . . Yes, I have the jacket. Hold on. . . . (to dogs) Fellas!
[Hospital]
TV: The Yankees take the field on a beautiful afternoon.
KRAMER: It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?
BOBBY: After Paul O'Neill hits his first home run.
[Jerry's]
HOLLY: (from buzzer) It's Holly.
JERRY: Yeah. Come on up.
TV: And the two and one pitch to O'Neill. A towering shot back to deep right field and it's gone.
[Hospital]
KRAMER: Yeah.
TV: A home run for Paul O'Neill. The Yanks lead one nothing.
KRAMER: OH YEAH! ALL RIGHT!
BOBBY: One more to go.
[Jerry's]
(Holly enters)
JERRY: Hey. What's all this?
HOLLY: I decided I was going to make you dinner.
JERRY: I thought we were going out.
HOLLY: Well, after you scarfed up my mutton I had the irresistible urge to make pork chops for you. I said hello to Franco for you.
JERRY: Franco?
HOLLY: Your butcher, down the street.
JERRY: I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
HOLLY: A little.
JERRY: That is so Franco.
[Hospital]
TV: Bottom of the eighth, score tied at one apiece. Two and one to Paul O'Neill.
KRAMER: You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill.
KRAMER: He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me.
TV: "Klick! Long fly ball into deep left field over Bell's head . . . O'Neill's rounding second O'Neill going for third, O'Neill rounding . . .
KRAMER: Come on Come on!
TV: . . . third being waived in.
KRAMER: GO! GO!!
TV: . . . Martinez throws it over Alomar's head. O'Neill is safe at home. And the Yankees take the lead.
KRAMER: An In The Park Home Run!
BOBBY: Yeay!
KRAMER: All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way (grabs framed card)
TV: That's being scored a triple for Paul O'Neill with a throwing error charged to Martinez.
BOBBY: Hey, …
KRAMER: Huh?
BOBBY: … that's not a home run. (grabs frame)
KRAMER: Yeah, maybe not technically, but …
BOBBY: You said he'd hit two home runs.
KRAMER: Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!
BOBBY: Well, you're not taking that card.
KRAMER: Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that …
[Jerry's]
HOLLY: So, is the chop the way you like it?
JERRY: I usually like mine with an angioplasty.
(stuffs meat in sofa)
(Elaine enters)
ELAINE: You know something really stinks to high h… Holly! What are you doing here?
JERRY: What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.
ELAINE: I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.
HOLLY: What about the napkins?
ELAINE: I didn't take your napkins.
HOLLY: Then who did?
ELAINE: Ask Jerry.
JERRY: We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.
[George's office, Yankee Stadium]
WILHELM: I still want to know what happened to that birthday card? Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?
MORGAN: No sir, George never gave it to me.
GEORGE: No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hi,
WILHELM: What's this?
KRAMER: Oh, it's a birthday card.
KRAMER: (to George) Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat.
WILHELM: George, this is beautiful. Why didn't you tell me you were going to have it mounted like this?
KRAMER: And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.
WILHELM: Ha ha ha ha ha, George, keep up the good work.
MORGAN: Ha ha, uh, well you screwed me again, Costanza. How am I supposed to sign the card now when it's already under glass?
[Jerry's]
(James enters with his dogs)
ELAINE: Uh, this is,…
HOLLY: Excuse me. What are those dogs wearing?
JAMES: Oh, bandanas, aren't they cute?
HOLLY: You gave Memma's napkins to some dogs?!
JERRY: Hey, what happened to my jacket?
JAMES: Oh, the dogs did that but it wasn't their fault, somebody stuffed some strange meat in the pocket.
HOLLY: Was it mutton?
JAMES: Could have been.
HOLLY: Do you always stuff meat in your pocket?
(Dogs climbing on sofa)
JERRY: Uh, sometimes I use the sofa.
[Steinbrenner's office]
(George enters)
GEORGE: You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
STEINBRENNER: Yes, George, please, come in, come in.
STEINBRENNER: Thanks for the card. I loved it. Gosh it made me feel good. You know, word has it that you were the brains behind the whole thing.
GEORGE: Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan.
STEINBRENNER: Morgan, Morgan, you know his name is conspicuously absent from this card. Almost like he went out of his way not to sign it.
GEORGE: Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir.
STEINBRENNER: You can stop kowtowing to Morgan. Congratulations, you got his job.
GEORGE: Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right for it.
STEINBRENNER: Stop it George, he's out, you're in.
STEINBRENNER: A lot more work you know.
GEORGE: I know.
STEINBRENNER: A lot more responsibility. Long long hours.
GEORGE: I know.
STEINBRENNER: Not much more money. But you'll finally get the recognition you deserve.
GEORGE: That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . .
STEINBRENNER: You know as painfull as it is I had to let a few people go over the years. Yogi Berra, Lou Pinella, Bucky Dent, Billy Martin, Dallas Green, Dick Houser, Bill Virdon, Billy Martin, Scott Marrow, Billy Martin, Bob Lemmon, Billy Martin, Gene Michael, Buck Showalter, … uh, tut!, . . .George, you didn't hear that from me. (George exits) . . . George!
[Opening Monologue]
I always feel bad for the silver medal winner in the Olympics. How do you live with that the rest of your life? People are gonna keep asking: - How much did you lose by? - I don't even know...! It was like...(very fast) now.now...now.now..now..was like, like... now..now..now...! It was it...! Eh, it was it and I lost. I trained, I worked out, I exercised, I did everything, I was doing push-ups, sit-ups, I never did anything but exercise and work out for 20 years, I flew half way around the world and aaaaaaaaaah!...(showing a tiny distance between his index and thumb) And that was...it was a photo-finish! Silver...(stretching his neck forward)...gold. If I had a pimple, I would've won.
[Monk's Restaurant - Jerry, George, Elaine]
JERRY: (to Elaine) I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog. (to George) Get this one: "I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest".
GEORGE: This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.
ELAINE: Yeah. What do you do all day?
GEORGE: Not that much.
ELAINE: uh-uh.
JERRY: I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.
GEORGE: Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.
JERRY: How do you pull that off?
GEORGE: I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Think about it... (acts annoyed for 3 seconds).
ELAINE: Yeah, you do! He looks very busy!
JERRY: Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah!
GEORGE: I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. (gets up) Back to work. (acts annoyed and leaves)
ELAINE: (laughs)
JERRY: So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?
ELAINE: No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.
JERRY: What marathon runner?
ELAINE: You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running...
JERRY: Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?!
ELAINE: Yeah, that's him.
JERRY: He's from uh...Trinidad and Tobago, right?
ELAINE: Yeah, he's Trinidadian and...Tobagan. (laughs)
JERRY: How do you oversleep at the Olympics...?
ELAINE: Ah, I know. I know...!
JERRY: I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door...
ELAINE: Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years.
JERRY: Ah...that's a big responsability on your hands.
ELAINE: What responsibility? I don't have any responsibility.
JERRY: You gotta wake him up!
ELAINE: Eh...he'll get up...
(A woman passes by with a baby)
ELAINE: Hi, Judy.
JUDY: Hi, Elaine. How are you?
ELAINE: Fine. (laughs)
(woman leaves)
JERRY: I've seen her in your building.
ELAINE: Yeah.
JERRY: I didn't know she was married.
ELAINE: (whispering) She's not... and the guy just took off. (makes a sad face) Don't say anything to anybody.
JERRY: Whom I gonna tell?
ELAINE: I know, it's just something you have to say...
[George's office at the Yankee Stadium]
(George is reading a newspaper when he hears a fly that lands on his desk. He tries to kill it with the paper but misses. Mr. Wilhelm comes in. George switches to annoyed-mode)
WILHELM: George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went over budget on some of the items, but I don't think there's gonna be a problem. (hands over the budget file to a very annoyed George) I'll let you get back to work, George. (Mr. Wilhelm leaves the office)
(George hears the fly again. It lands on the wall and he starts bashing it with the file. Mr. Wilhelm sees George hitting the wall with the budget file and shakes his head, worried)
[Jerry's apartment - Jerry, George]
JERRY: He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?
GEORGE: I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.
JERRY: My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on. (Kramer enters with a bucket and starts filling it with water on the sink) Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.
KRAMER: Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.
JERRY: What do you do?
KRAMER: I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and... (makes sound with the lips - "pop!") ...I get up!
JERRY: Always works?
KRAMER: It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is.
GEORGE: uh-uh. What's with the bucket?
KRAMER: Lomez, he sold me his hot tub.
JERRY: Hot tub?
KRAMER: Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. (points to bucket)
GEORGE: You put a hot tub... in your living room?
KRAMER: Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating, soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees! (happy)
GEORGE: Is that tolerable?
KRAMER: Oh...it's tolerable...! (happy)
JERRY: Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?
KRAMER: Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... (smiles and leaves)
GEORGE: He uh...doesn't have any running water?
JERRY: I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
[Monk's Restaurant - Jerry]
(Elaine and Jean-Paul come in)
ELAINE: Jerry. Jerry, this is Jean-Paul.
JERRY: Ah, hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you.
JEAN-PAUL: Nice to meet you.
JERRY: Sorry about the Olympics.
JEAN-PAUL: Me too. (disappointed)
ELAINE: Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't...come up with anything for this thing.
JERRY: Ah...catalog writer's block?
ELAINE: Yeah, that's funny. (annoyed)
(Elaine leaves)
JERRY: (pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?
JEAN-PAUL: Man, it wasn't the snooze. Most people think it was the snooze, but no, no snooze.
JERRY: AM/PM.
JEAN-PAUL: Man, it wasn't the AM/PM. It was the volume.
JERRY: Ah...the volume.
JEAN-PAUL: Yes, the volume. There was a separate knob for the radio alarm.
JERRY: Ah, separate knob.
JEAN-PAUL: Yes, separate knob. Why separate knob?! Why separate knob?! (frustrated)
JERRY: Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.
JEAN-PAUL: Oh, please, man, please!
JERRY: Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.
(Elaine returns)
JERRY: Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?
ELAINE: Jerry...
JERRY: It's a simple question...
ELAINE: I've got an alarm, ok?
JERRY: That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?
JEAN-PAUL: Flight to Cleveland?
ELAINE: It works.
JERRY: Elaine...
ELAINE: It... works!
[George's office at the Yankee Stadium]
(George is doing the newspaper's crossword. The pen stops working.)
GEORGE: Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen. Mr. Wilhelm comes in)
(George switches to annoyed-mode again)
WILHELM: George...I think you may be taking work a little too seriously.
GEORGE: Well...I've got a lot to do!
WILHELM: George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd like you to drop everything.
(George acts annoyed)
WILHELM: I have this... fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. There's some reps in from the Houston Astros for talks on that interleague play... and I want you to show them a good time.(George acts like "ok, you're the boss")
[Jerry's apartment - Jerry]
(Elaine comes in)
ELAINE: Hey. Sorry I'm late.
JERRY: You're 40 minutes late. What happened?
ELAINE: I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
JERRY: No.
ELAINE: What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets the timer) What is the problem?
JERRY: Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.
ELAINE: uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what?
JERRY: Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!
ELAINE: Oh are you?!
JERRY: Yes I am.
ELAINE: Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!
JERRY: Yeah, I know that!
ELAINE: Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!
JERRY: I'm not talking about upside down. (Jean-Paul and Kramer come in) I'm talking about waking him up!
ELAINE: Hey, Jean-Paul.
JERRY: Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?
JEAN-PAUL: Ah, man, very good soak. The soak o'the year!
KRAMER: (smelling) What's burning?
ELAINE: Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave door) Oh, shoot! (slams it)
JERRY: What happened?
ELAINE: Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.
KRAMER: This was set for 2 minutes. See?
(Jerry raises his hands in the air, worried)
ELAINE: (pointing at Jerry) Don't say anything! Don't..say..anything!
JEAN-PAUL: You miss-set the timer...
ELAINE: (leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right, listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go.
JEAN-PAUL: Ok.
ELAINE: (to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?
JERRY: Yeah. I hope so ?!
ELAINE: Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul)
JERRY: Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over this whole operation!
KRAMER: Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak.
JERRY: I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.
KRAMER: Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the windows... the air is cold, the tub is boiling hot... It's like Sweden, man. Sweeeeden!
[Kramer's hot tub]
(The water is at 105.F degrees. Kramer takes his robe off and goes inside)
KRAMER: (relaxing) ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh... (he is really enjoying this)
[in a bar - George and 3 other men, drinking]
CLAYTON: ...'till this bastard over here says: "let's call the sons o'bitches and go visit 'em on New York!" (the 3 men laugh)
GEORGE: (smiling) Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it.
GARDNER: I like your organization, George. We've been talkin' to a really friendly son of a bitch in the front office. Wilhelm, I think his name.
GEORGE: Oh yes, Mr.Wilhelm, yeah...
GARDNER: He told us that George Costanza was gonna be takin' us bastards out on the town. (the 3 men laugh again) I said: "that son of a bitch doesn't know what he's got in store for him!". (the 3 men laugh once more)
ZEKE: Finish your drink?
GEORGE: Oh yeah, al-almost. Almost.
ZEKE: Let's get that bastard bring us another round! (waves to bartender)
CLAYTON: You a big drinker, George?
GEORGE: Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... (points at Zeke, they all laugh) I can hold my own! (they all continue laughing and drinking)
[Kramer's hot tub]
(The water is now at 53 degrees. Kramer is asleep inside and he's all trembling. He wakes up,
frozen, making trembling sounds, reaches for his robe and puts it on while in the tub.)
[Monk's Restaurant - Jerry, Jean-Paul]
JERRY: Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay... is uh...
JEAN-PAUL: What are you saying?
JERRY: I'm saying "get the hell outta there"! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call, Jean-Paul! A wake-up call!
JEAN-PAUL: Wake-up call...
JERRY: These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin' to make that call! (George comes in)
JEAN-PAUL: No, I will stay with Elaine. It would be rude.
GEORGE: Hey, you bastards.
JERRY: Hey, how was the meeting?
GEORGE: I really like those sons of bitches.
JERRY: Sons of bitches?
GEORGE: Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like uh..."boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!" (laughs)
JEAN-PAUL: Really?!
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. (laughs)
(Kramer walks in wearing winter coat, scarf, cap, gloves... They all look at him very surprised)
KRAMER: Heeeeey...
JERRY: How many sweaters you got on?
KRAMER: Oh...four. (to waitress) Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? Boiling hot.
GEORGE: What's goin'on?
KRAMER: I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up!
JERRY: Your core temperature?
KRAMER: (to Jean-Paul) Here, feel my hand. (takes off glove) Yeah, feel.
JEAN-PAUL: Phew... this son of a bitch is ice-cold. (smiles)
[inside an airplane - the 3 men]
(They are calling George at the Yankee Stadium, while they're drinking and laughing in the plane)
GEORGE: Hello?
CLAYTON: uh...is that you, George?
GEORGE: (laughs) Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?
CLAYTON: Well listen, you son of a bitch! You know where we are? 30 000 feet above your head, you bastard! (the 3 laugh and howl)
GEORGE: What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? Don't they know that's against FAA regulation?
CLAYTON: (to the other 2 men) Hey, hush up, now! I can't hear him!
GEORGE: Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys can't wait to kick your butts!
ZEKE: (to Clayton) When's that bastard comin' to Houston?
CLAYTON: Hey, Zeke wants to know when you Yankee bastards are comin' to Houston!
GEORGE: You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you bastards are running things.
CLAYTON: Hey, uh, speak up, George, I can't hear ya!
GEORGE: (Mr.Wilhelm comes in and hears George yelling) You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!
(Mr.Wilhelm comes running, takes the phone from George and hangs up)
WILHELM: George! George, get a hold of yourself!
GEORGE: Mr.Wilhelm...
WILHELM: What's the matter with you?!
GEORGE: Well I-I...
[Elaine's office - Elaine]
(She's trying to think of a story for the shoes while she's at the computer)
ELAINE: (thinking and typing) It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... (hits the keyboard) Oh! This stinks! (grabs a Himalayan walking shoe and starts squeezing it for inspiration) Oh, come on... come on...!...God! (quits)
[Elaine's building - Jean-Paul, Judy with baby]
JEAN-PAUL: Hello.
JUDY: Hello.
JEAN-PAUL: I'm a friend of Elaine's.
JUDY: Oh, hi.
JEAN-PAUL: (looks at the baby) oooooh...look at the cute little bastard... (the building manager comes in) you are mama's little bastard, aren't you? (laughs)
(Judy goes away angry and Jean-Paul is surprised by that)
MANAGER: Whatta hell are you doin' harassing my tenants?
JEAN-PAUL: (smiling) Oh come on, you son of a bitch. I'm just trying to be friendly.
MANAGER: All right, that's it! (grabs Jean-Paul and gets him out) Let's go!
JEAN-PAUL: What...but I got a race tomorrow!
[Jerry's apartment at night- Kramer]
(Kramer is lying on Jerry's sofa, "fully" dressed and covered with a blanket. Jerry and George come in)
GEORGE: Whoa...it's like a furnace in here!
JERRY: Oh whatta hell is goin'on?!
KRAMER: Yeah, I turned up the heat.
JERRY: Turn up the heat in your apartment! (opens a window)
KRAMER: I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.
GEORGE: Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?
KRAMER: Uh? Oh that must be it.
GEORGE: It's huge!
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. 16000 BTU's.
(Kramer leaves. The phone rings and Jerry picks it up)
JERRY: Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count on me! (hangs up)
GEORGE: (Jerry is going to his bedroom) What?
JERRY: I got the call...!
GEORGE: Jean-Paul?
JERRY: (stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored)
[hotel - Jerry, Jean-Paul. Sitting in different beds]
JERRY: Pretty lucky to find this hotel, Jean-Paul.
JEAN-PAUL: Man, I just want to get some sleep. (gets into bed)
JERRY: All right. (picks up the alarm clock) Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 6:50... volume check. (music playing, he starts swinging) What kinda music you wanna wake up to? Top 40, classical...
JEAN-PAUL: Man, whatever! (annoyed)
JERRY: How about adult contemporary?
JEAN-PAUL: Fine, adult contemporary. Just pick one! (irritated)
JERRY: All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm away, gets phone) now... the failsafe. The wake-up guy... (dials)
JEAN-PAUL: Yes, yes, the wake-up guy.
MAN: (on the phone) Front desk...?
JERRY: Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 6:50 AM tomorrow morning.
MAN: Yes sir.
JERRY: That's room 419. 6:50 AM. Four...one...niner...
MAN: Yes, I got it sir. You only had to say it once.
JERRY: I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.
MAN: Every wake-up call I make is important. You're no more important than any of our guests.
JERRY: Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...
MAN: Are you through? (annoyed)
JERRY: ...Yeah I am, but I just...(man hangs-up)
(Jerry pauses thinking)
JERRY: humm...
JEAN-PAUL: What is it...?
JERRY: I think I offended the wake-up guy...! (worried)
JEAN-PAUL: No, no.
JERRY: (gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!
JEAN-PAUL: Man, he doesn't got "in" for you.
JERRY: What if he doesn't call now out of spite?
JEAN-PAUL: It is his job!
(Jerry sits down)
JERRY: (pause) Not comfortable... (gets up again)
JEAN-PAUL: For God's sake...! (gets up and they start packing)
[Elaine's apartment]
(Elaine comes in)
ELAINE: Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? (worried) Jean-Paul?! Oh man... (calling Jerry's) Oh...machine.
JERRY'S MACHINE: I'm not here, leave a message.
ELAINE: Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back. (hangs up)
(She leaves her apartment and knocks on Judy's door)
ELAINE: Judy, hi, listen...
JUDY: You have got some nerve, Elaine! I told you about that baby in confidence!
ELAINE: Oh I didn't tell anyone.
JUDY: Well your friend certainly seemed to know all about it. (shuts the door)
ELAINE: ... Jerry! (runs angry to her apartment)
[Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry and Jean-Paul come in)
JERRY: Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.
JEAN-PAUL: It's a marathon, you know. 26 miles! I need to get some sleep! (lies on the sofa)
JERRY: Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal right now. (covers Jean-Paul with a blanket)
JEAN-PAUL: Left a comfortable hotel bedroom for this!
JERRY: That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. (goes knocking on Kramer's)
(Kramer checks the water temperature and then opens the door)
JERRY: (shouting) Man that thing is noisy!
KRAMER: (shouting) Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!
JERRY: Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 6:30 and gimme a call.
KRAMER: Yeah, ok. Wait. (concentrates and makes the "pop!" sound) Done! (Jerry stares, confused)
[street at night- Elaine walking and thinking, very worried]
(the following voices are on Elaine's mind)
JERRY: He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.
JEAN-PAUL: I trust Elaine, she is my friend. I trust Elaine, she is my friend.
JERRY: Frankly, I'm a little concerned.
ELAINE: Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet (stops to look at her feet) ...my feet are resilient! (a big smile grows in her face, as she thinks...) Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES!!! (lifting her arms up in the air, in ecstasy, as she says...) Yes!
[Jerry's apartment]
(Two clocks at a table, both 4:02 AM. Jean-Paul's sleeping at the sofa)
[Kramer's apartment]
(4:02 AM. Kramer snores. The heat pump short circuits and blows the fuses on the entire building)
[Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry wakes up with the sunlight. Looks at the electric clock, which stopped at 4:02)
JERRY: 4:02? (Checks his wristwatch) Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup!
(gets out of bedroom, in panic) Jean-Paul! The electricity went out! Wake up! Wake up!
We gotta go! It's 8:47!
JEAN-PAUL: 8:47!? (jumps out of the sofa)
(both running around, getting ready to go)
JERRY: Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car!
JEAN-PAUL: Idiot! I trusted you!
(Kramer comes in wrapped up in a blanket)
JERRY: Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!
KRAMER: Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!
JERRY: What happened to your mental alarm?!
KRAMER: I guess I hit the snooze... (Jerry runs by Kramer and Kramer falls down)
[New York marathon]
(Jerry and Jean-Paul try to get to the starting line through a crowd)
JERRY: Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender! (an event guard stops them)
GUAD: Hey, hold it!
JEAN-PAUL: I'm late, man, I'm in the race!
GUARD: Go ahead.
JEAN-PAUL: Thank you Jerry, you're a wonderful driver. Fantastic route, man!
JERRY: All right, go, it's a race! Come on!
[George Steinbrenner's office at the Yankee Stadium]
(George comes in)
GEORGE: You wanted to see me, Mr.Steinbrenner?
STEINBRENNER: Yes, George, come in, come in. George, word up's you've been cracking under the pressure. Can't cope, can't stand the heat. Spit the bit.
GEORGE: Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain...
STEINBRENNER: Oh we all get a little cuckoo sometimes George, I used to be like you. Rating personnel 'till they cried, calling managers on the field during a game, threatening to move the team to New Jersey, just to upset people. Then I found a way to relax. I've got two words to say to you, George hot tub. (George looks at him, puzzled)
[New York marathon - Jerry, Elaine, Kramer]
(They're waiting for the runners to run by. Kramer remains "fully" dressed and is carrying a thermos with tea).
JERRY: I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!
ELAINE: Then how did she find out, Jerry?!
JERRY: Maybe you should check with the rabbi.
KRAMER: (to Elaine) You want some hot tea?
ELAINE: Oh no, thank you.
KRAMER: Oh. There's some runners. Here they come!
(The first runner to appear is Jean-Paul)
ELAINE: There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)
KRAMER: Oh yeah! Yeah! Come on! (starts howling)
JERRY: Come on, let's go Jean-Paul!
ELAINE: Go Jean-Paaaaaul!
(We switch over to Jean-Paul. We hear him breathing. We hear his heart beating. Some people offer him drinks. Jean-Paul grabs one, Kramer's hot tea, and leaves scene. Kramer gets very surprised. We then hear Jean-Paul screaming in pain, and it's not hard to guess why. Kramer puts on a "whatta hell" look, Elaine puts on an "ouch" look and Jerry puts on his "it's a shame" one.)
[George and Mr.Steinbrenner inside a hot tub]
STEINBRENNER: How're you enjoying it, George? Melts that tension away, doesn't it? You gotta get that jet on the good spot. Oh. Oh. Uh. Uh. Yes, that feels good. Yes, that's real good. Oh yeah, that's where I keep all my tension. Right down to that chicken bone. Sometimes I get my wife to just stuck her thumb right in there like a screwdriver. Ya know, the Phillips head, not the flat one. Oh God, those flat ones frustrate me. You got it in, but it slips out. You put it in again, slips out again. You a single man, George?
GEORGE: (bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh...
STEINBRENNER: I'll tell you, if you wanna get something wild goin'on in your life, you get a girl and bring her to one o'these things. Just like 4 shots a wild turkey. (laughs) She'll think you're Hopalong Cassidy. (George starts sliding, until he gets all his head -and glasses- under water, as Steinbrenner keeps talking) A show, about that Mickey Mantle, wasn't it? You know we used to talk. I don't think he liked me very much, you know.
GEORGE: All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.
JERRY: Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?
SHEILA: You called me shmoppy. You're a shmoopy.
JERRY: You're a shmoopy!
SHEILA: You're a shmoopy!
JERRY: You're a shmoopy!
GEORGE: All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.
JERRY: Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?
SHEILA: No. You have a good lunch. But I'll meet you back here for the movie.
GEORGE: Hey.
ELAINE: Hey.
SHEILA: Hi Elaine.
ELAINE: Hi Sheila.
JERRY: All right, then. I'll see you later.
SHEILA: Bye shmoopy.
JERRY: Bye shmoopy.
ELAINE: Okay. We ready to go?
GEORGE: Yes. Please. Please, let's go.
ELAINE: Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.
JERRY: No. We gotta go to the soup place.
ELAINE: What soup place?
GEORGE: Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.
JERRY: He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.
ELAINE: Stunned by soup?
JERRY: You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.
ELAINE: Huh. All right. Come on.
JERRY: There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.
ELAINE: Why? What happens if you don't order right?
JERRY: He yells and you don't get your soup.
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
GEORGE: All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.
JERRY: All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: The main thing is to keep the line moving.
GEORGE: All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.
JERRY: Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.
ELAINE: Oh, boy, I'm really scared!
JERRY: Elaine.
ELAINE: All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.
JERRY: Ar-moire.
ELAINE: How much is this?
FURNITURE GUY: I was asking 250, but you got a nice face. 2 even.
ELAINE: Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.
JERRY: He gave you the nice face discount.
ELAINE: Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead.
JERRY: What about the soup?
ELAINE: I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.
JERRY: [in French accent] Pardon.
GEORGE: This line is huge.
JERRY: It's like this all the time.
GEORGE: Isn't that that Bania guy?
JERRY: Oh, no. It is. Just be still.
GEORGE: Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.
BANIA: Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup.
JERRY: Hard to believe.
BANIA: This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi.
JERRY: Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.
BANIA: Why not?
JERRY: Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.
BANIA: Okay. Okay.
GEORGE: Medium turkey chili.
JERRY: Medium crab bisque.
GEORGE: I didn't get any bread.
JERRY: Just forget it. Let it go.
GEORGE: Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.
SOUP NAZI: Bread -- $2 extra.
GEORGE: $2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.
SOUP NAZI: You want bread?
GEORGE: Yes, please.
SOUP NAZI: $3!
GEORGE: What?
SOUP NAZI: No soup for you! [snaps fingers]
(cahsier takes George's soup and gives him back his money)
ELAINE: What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.
SUPER: Its Sunday, Elaine. There's no moving on Sunday. That's the rule.
ELAINE: But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.
SUPER: Tomorrow, okay? You can move it in tommorrow. I'll even give you a hand, all right?
ELAINE: Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.
FURNITURE GUY: I'm a guy on the sidewalk. I don't have layaway.
ELAINE: Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.
JERRY: Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?
GEORGE: You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?
JERRY: I gave you a taste. What do you want?
GEORGE: Why can't we share?
JERRY: I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!
GEORGE: Do you hear yourself?
JERRY: I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
GEORGE: Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.
SHEILA: Hi. Hi shmoopy.
JERRY: Hi shmoopy.
SHEILA: No, you're a shmoopy!
JERRY: You're a shmoopy!
GEORGE: I'm going.
JERRY: Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?
GEORGE: You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.
JERRY: Why?
GEORGE: I just don't feel like it anymore.
JERRY: Just like that?
GEORGE: Just like that.
SHEILA: Boy, he's a weird guy, isn't he?
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
KRAMER: [taking Jerry's couch cushion] Yeah.
JERRY: Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?
KRAMER: Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on.
JERRY: Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.
KRAMER: Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!
ELAINE: Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.
KRAMER: Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.
ELAINE: Do you need anything?
KRAMER: Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.
ELAINE: Mulligatawny?
KRAMER: Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.
ELAINE: Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?
KRAMER: He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are.
ELAINE: All right. I'll be back.
KRAMER: Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.
ELAINE: Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it.
KRAMER: No. No, Elaine!
ELAINE: Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?
GEORGE: No. I didn't get it.
ELAINE: Why? What happened?
GEORGE: I made a mistake.
ELAINE: [laughing]
GEORGE: All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.
ELAINE: Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.
GEORGE: Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?
ELAINE: Oh, I know! It is awful!
GEORGE: Why do they have to do that in front of people?
ELAINE: I don't know.
GEORGE: What is that with the shmoopy?
ELAINE: Ohh!
GEORGE: The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!
ELAINE: Ohh! Stop it! I know.
GEORGE: I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy.
ELAINE: Ugh!
GEORGE: And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.
ELAINE: You know, we should say something.
GEORGE: You know, we absolutely should.
ELAINE: I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?
GEORGE: I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.
ELAINE: Yeah.
GEORGE: I still haven't figured him out.
ELAINE: No. Me neither.
GEORGE: All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.
ELAINE: Oh, God!
GEORGE: Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.
SOUP NAZI: You're pushing your luck little man.
GEORGE: Sorry. Thank you.
ELAINE: Hi there. Um, uh -- [drumming on countertop] Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and, um.... what is that right there? Is that lima bean?
SOUP NAZI: Yes.
ELAINE: Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, " Scent Of A Woman." Who-ah! Who-ah!
SOUP NAZI: Very good. Very good.
ELAINE: Well, I --
SOUP NAZI: You know something?
ELAINE: Hmmm?
SOUP NAZI: No soup for you!
ELAINE: What?
SOUP NAZI: Come back one year! Next!
RAY: Look at this.
BOB: It's an antique.
RAY: It's all hand made and I love the in-lay.
BOB: Yes. Yes. me, too. Ay, it's gorgeous. Completely. Pick it up. No. No. Pick it up from the bottom over there.
KRAMER: Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
BOB: What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this.
KRAMER: You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.
BOB: Look, you wanna get hurt?
KRAMER: Huh?
BOB: I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get hurt I can hurt you. Now, just back off.
RAY: Bob.
BOB: Just pick it up.
KRAMER: What is this, huh?
BOB: You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding? We taking the armoire and that's all there is to it. Okay?
ELAINE: I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am.
GEORGE: Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.
ELAINE: All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire?
KRAMER: Well, b -- it was stolen.
ELAINE: Wha--?
KRAMER: These street toughs, they robbed me.
ELAINE: Street toughs took my armoire?
KRAMER: Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me.
ELAINE: I can't believe this!
KRAMER: Well, where's the soup?
ELAINE: Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.
KRAMER: Oh...yeah!
JERRY: What are you gonna get?
SHEILA: I'll decide at the last minute.
JERRY: You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!
(Soup Nazi pounding on countertop)
JERRY: Uh-oh.
SOUP NAZI: Hey, what is this? You're kissing in my line? Nobody kisses in my line!
SHEILA: I can kiss anywhere I want to.
SOUP NAZI: You just cost yourself a soup!
SHEILA: How dare you? Come on, Jerry, we're leaving. Jerry?
JERRY: Do I know you?
ELAINE: So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?
JERRY: It was a bisque.
ELAINE: Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.
JERRY: Really?
ELAINE: Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup.
JERRY: Have you tastes the soup?
ELAINE: Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.
JERRY: See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.
JERRY: Hey.
KRAMER: Yeah.
ELAINE: Hey.
KRAMER: Yeah.
JERRY: Oh, thanks.
ELAINE: There he is.
KRAMER: Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire.
ELAINE: Yeah. I know. Me, too.
JERRY: So, did these thieves want any money?
KRAMER: No.
JERRY: They just wanted the armoire?
KRAMER: Yeah. They were..quite taken with it.
(interom buzzes)
JERRY: Yeah?
GEORGE: Hup! Hup!
JERRY: Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?
ELAINE: No. In what way?
JERRY: I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something.
ELAINE: I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
GEORGE: Hello.
JERRY: Hello.
KRAMER: Hey.
GEORGE: Hello.
ELAINE: Hello.
GEORGE: Were you just talking about me? What's going on?
JERRY: Absolutely not.
GEORGE: Something's going on here.
KRAMER: All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup.
ELAINE: One of these days that guy is gonna get his.
GEORGE: So, how was the movie?
JERRY: Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.
GEORGE: Oh, yeah?
JERRY: Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?
GEORGE: Happy? Why should I be happy?
JERRY: I don't know, but you look like you're happy.
GEORGE: Why should I care?
JERRY: You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy.
GEORGE: All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?
(Elaine sneaks out of Jerry's apartment)
JERRY: Is that so?
GEORGE: Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!
JERRY: Disgusting?
GEORGE: People who do that should be arrested.
JERRY: Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.
GEORGE: Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know.
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: You shook my hand in that coffee shop.
JERRY: You're still with the pact?
GEORGE: Mmm-hmm. You reneged.
JERRY: All I did was shake your hand.
GEORGE: Ah-ha!
KRAMER: And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.
SOUP NAZI: Ohh! This city.
NEWMAN: One large jambalaya, please.
SOUP NAZI: So, continue.
KRAMER: Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional.
NEWMAN: Thank you. [inhaling deeply] Jambalaya!
SOUP NAZI: All right, now listen to me. You have been a good friend. I have an armoire in my basement. If you want to pick it up, you're welcome to it. So, take it, it's yours.
KRAMER: How can I possibly thank you?
SOUP NAZI: You are the only one who understands me.
KRAMER: You suffer for your soup.
SOUP NAZI: Yes. That is right.
KRAMER: You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.
SOUP NAZI: How can I tolerate any less from my customer?
CUSTOMER: Uh, gazpacho, por favor.
SOUP NAZI: Por favor?
CUSTOMER: Um, I'm part Spanish.
SOUP NAZI: Adios muchacho!
KRAMER: Git.
JERRY: It was stupid of me.
SHEILA: Well, it was very insulting.
JERRY: No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
SHEILA: Well, behind every joke there's some truth.
JERRY: What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says " Aw, I'll just have some coffee." There's no truth to that.
SHEILA: Well, I guess you're right.
JERRY: So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?
SHEILA: Yes, shmoopy.
JERRY: Aw!
SUSAN: Hey, Jerry!
JERRY: Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila.
GEORGE: Oh, yes. Hello.
SHEILA: Hello. Won't you join us?
GEORGE: No, thanks.
SUSAN: Of course.
GEORGE: Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?
JERRY: Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?
GEORGE: I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty.
JERRY: Well, we're changing the rules.
GEORGE: Ahh. Good for you.
SUSAN: Aw, what are you getting George?
GEORGE: I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?
SUSAN: Oh, George, you're so sweet.
GEORGE: Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.
SUSAN: Aww!
JERRY: What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy?
SHEILA: Yeah.
JERRY: Yum yum little tuna fishy?
GEORGE: Come here.
[George & Susan begin making out; Jerry & Sheila begin making out in order to keep up]
KRAMER: And..voila!
ELAINE: [gasps]
KRAMER: Yeah.
ELAINE: Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!
KRAMER: Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?
ELAINE: The K Man did it!
KRAMER: Yeah!
ELAINE: [laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?
KRAMER: How 'bout zero?
ELAINE: What?
KRAMER: Yeah.
ELAINE: What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?
KRAMER: I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.
ELAINE: Get out!
[Elaine pushes on Kramer's chest, causing in to fall backwards through her swinging door]
ELAINE: The Soup Nazi gave it to you?
KRAMER: Yeah.
ELAINE: Why?
KRAMER: Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man.
ELAINE: [gasps]
KRAMER: Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....
ELAINE: Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!
KRAMER: Yeah. Well, he's a dear.
GEORGE: How much tip do you leave on $8.15?
SUSAN: You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship.
GEORGE: Huh?
SUSAN: [in babying voice] Because you love your little kiki don't you?
CUSTOMER: How is he today?
BANIA: I think he's in a good mood.
ELAINE: Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
SOUP NAZI: You? If I knew it was for you, I never would have given it to him in the first place! I would have taken a hatchet and smashed it to pieces! Now, who wants soup? Next! Speak up!
JERRY: I'm heading over to Elaine's.
KRAMER: Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.
JERRY: Those two?
KRAMER: Yeah.
JERRY: Are you sure?
KRAMER: Yeah. That's them.
JERRY: Well, let's confront 'em.
KRAMER: No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.
JERRY: There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.
KRAMER: No!
JERRY: Let's go.
BOB: Oh, wow look, that one is gorgeous. I would just kill for that one.
RAY: Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all.
BOB: Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't think you know what you're talking about. Take a look at that.
KRAMER: Excuse me.
RAY: Are you talking to me?
KRAMER: Uh, well, uh, we --
RAY: I said, are you talking to me?
BOB: Well, maybe, he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you talking to?!
KRAMER: Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?
[Jerry & Kramer turn around and run away]
ELAINE: I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?
JERRY: I don't know. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley..."
ELAINE: Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!
JERY: So?
ELAINE: So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.
JERRY: Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?
ELAINE: What do you care?
JERRY: Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.
ELAINE: Get out of my way, Jerry.
JERRY: Elaine, let the man make his soup!
ELAINE: Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.
SUSAN: Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby bluey?
GEORGE: Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey.
JERRY: Well. Well.
SUSAN: Hi, Jerry.
JERRY: Hey, Susan, George.
SUSAN: You know, I really like Sheila a lot.
JERRY: Oh, really?
SUSAN: Mmm-hmm.
JERRY: Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
SUSAN: Oh, no! That's too bad.
JERRY: Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.
GEORGE: Really?
JERRY: Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.
SUSAN: Mmm-hmm.
GEORGE: You did?
JERRY: Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.
GEORGE: Yeah. See ya.
SOUP NAZI: Go on! Leave! Get out!
WOMAN: But I didn't do anything.
SOUP NAZI: Next!
ELAINE: Hello.
SOUP NAZI: You. You think you can get soup? Please. You're wasting everyone's time.
ELAINE: I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery."
SOUP NAZI: That is my recipe for wild mushroom.
ELAINE: Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny.
SOUP NAZI: Mulliga...tawny?
ELAINE: You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
NEWMAN: [panting] Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
JERRY: What is it?
NEWMAN: Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!
JERRY: Wha - wha - what's the matter?
NEWMAN: Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more for of us!
JERRY: Well, where are you going?
NEWMAN: He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!
[Opening monologue]
They really got us trained to use that cash machine now, don't they? We're just like chickens in an experiment waiting for that pellet to come down the chute. You see people at the cash machine; they're just there. Just, dit dit dit dit dit dit dit, they're waiting for the sound, you know the sound, you're waiting for the sound. That's what we're trained to hear, the 'here comes the money' sound, ya know? Flip flip flip flip flip flip flip. It's exciting, don't you get excited? It's coming! It's coming! They're giving me money!
[George and Susan are in George's apartment.]
SUSAN: Hey, I gotta get some cash, I'm gonna run down to the ATM.
GEORGE: Yeah, I better grab some too.
SUSAN: I'll get it for you; just give me your card.
GEORGE: You sure?
SUSAN: Yeah, just tell me your code.
GEORGE: My code?
[Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.]
JERRY: So why didn't you tell her the code?
GEORGE: No. No way.
JERRY: George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.
GEORGE: It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'
JERRY: So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?
GEORGE: Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?
JERRY: Actually, that's the definition of selfish.
GEORGE: Have you ever given your code to anyone?
JERRY: No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'
GEORGE: Superman's father on Krypton.
JERRY: Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.
GEORGE: No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.
JERRY: What if my life depended on it?
GEORGE: If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code.
(Jerry stands up and begins limping.)
GEORGE: What's the matter with your leg?
JERRY: My foot fell asleep.
GEORGE: How'd your foot fall asleep?
JERRY: I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.
(A friend of George and Jerry's walks up to the table.)
FRED: Hey Jerry.
JERRY: Hey Fred.
GEORGE: Hey Fred.
JERRY: My foot fell asleep.
FRED: You're lucky, at least you got something to do.
(Elaine walks in.)
JERRY: Fred, do you know Elaine?
FRED: No, it's nice to meet you. Well, I'm outta here, see you guys.
GEORGE: Alright, bye.
JERRY: Seeya.
ELAINE: Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'
JERRY: So?
ELAINE: So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes.
JERRY: And he didn't remember you?
(Elaine gets up to leave.)
JERRY: Where are you going, you just got here?
ELAINE: I gotta go talk to him.
[Elaine catches up to Fred on the street.]
ELAINE: Excuse me, excuse me, Fred?
FRED: Yeah?
ELAINE: You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.
FRED: We have?
ELAINE: Yeah, at Katie Ash's party?
FRED: What was your name again?
ELAINE: Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald?
FRED: Not ringing a bell.
ELAINE: When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'?
FRED: Mmm, no.
ELAINE: That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.
FRED: The bathroom door. I remember someone had played tic-tac-toe on it, and the X's won; they went diagonally from the top left to the bottom right.
[Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone.]
JERRY: Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun.
(Kramer enters holding a police scanner.)
JERRY: Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do some TV spots for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store. That was Leapin' Larry himself, I'm gonna meet with him tomorrow.
KRAMER: Leapin' Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this.
JERRY: What is that?
KRAMER: Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything: Fires, harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we got a big fire on 115th. I tell ya if could do it over again, I'd give it all up to be a fireman.
JERRY: Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.
KRAMER: When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that big hook and ladder.
JERRY: You're lucky they let you drive a car.
KRAMER: No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools.
(Kramer runs out, Elaine enters.)
ELAINE: What was that?
JERRY: (waving his arm in dismissal) Eh.
ELAINE: Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me.
JERRY: Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women.
ELAINE: What are you saying?
JERRY: Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you.
ELAINE: Yeah, but why? I mean, ya know.
JERRY: I know.
ELAINE: Ya know?
JERRY: Yeah, I know.
ELAINE: Huh, lookit, you got the new catalog.
JERRY: Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
ELAINE: Too good. Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to dinner tomorrow. Maybe you wanna come with me.
JERRY: Why would I wanna do that?
ELAINE: Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful.
JERRY: Yeah, sounds like fun.
[George and Susan are at George's apartment.]
SUSAN: I want you to tell me, George.
GEORGE: Why? Why is my code so important?
SUSAN: Because, it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust. We're not supposed to keep secrets from one another.
GEORGE: Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles.
SUSAN: My cycles?
GEORGE: Yeah, I never know what's going on there.
SUSAN: Well from now on I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.
GEORGE: Please.
SUSAN: Anything else?
GEORGE: We're out of Bosco!
[Jerry and Leapin' Larry are in the office at the appliance store.]
JERRY: Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our prices, we'll give you the store.
LEAPIN' LARRY: Ya know I've always liked your comedy, you don't take cheap shots.
JERRY: No I don't.
LEAPIN' LARRY: Sorry for keeping you here so long. Again, I apologize for the mess. This renovation is killing me.
JERRY: (to himself) My foot's asleep again!
(Leapin' Larry walks out from behind his desk, he has a severe limp)
LEAPIN' LARRY: When I lost my leg in the boating accident, I got so depressed about this damn prosthetic I thought I was gonna have to give up the business. But now I'm rejuvenated. Let me show you around the store.
JERRY: You know what? I'll be with you in a minute.
(Jerry stands and begins to 'walk off' his sleeping foot. A Leapin' Larry's employee begins laughing.)
EMPLOYEE: That is a great impression!
(Leapin' Larry walks in, sees Jerry, and is obviously disappointed. Jerry is embarrassed.)
JERRY: Larry, wait, you don't understand!
[Jerry and Kramer are in Jerry's apartment.]
KRAMER: I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is that what you've sunk to?
JERRY: I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.
KRAMER: Oh, oh your foot fell asleep.
JERRY: Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it.
KRAMER: Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?
(Jerry's door buzzer rings, Jerry presses the button.)
JERRY: Yup.
VOICE: Hup.
(A news bulletin is shown on the TV.)
KRAMER: Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday.
JERRY: Wow, the whole building burned down.
KRAMER: They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes?
JERRY: Of course.
KRAMER: It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.
JERRY: The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.
(Kramer leaves, George enters.)
GEORGE: Where we gonna eat?
JERRY: We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.
GEORGE: Peterman? Nobody mentioned anything about Peterman.
JERRY: Of course not, if I did would you have gone?
GEORGE: No way.
JERRY: There you go.
GEORGE: I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be off.
JERRY: Trust me, you're off.
[Elaine bumps into Fred on the street.]
ELAINE: Oh, hi Fred.
FRED: Um, hello?
ELAINE: It's Elaine.
FRED: Oh yeah, yeah, right.
ELAINE: How ya doin'?
FRED: I'm depressed. I got this new shirt, the button fell off. Once the button falls off, that's it. I'll never fix it.
ELAINE: Yeah, that's too bad.
FRED: Yeah, I'm gonna get some vitamins, I feel depleted.
ELAINE: Hmm. I never take them.
FRED: Cause they make you nauseous, right?
ELAINE: Yeah! Yeah, that's right, you remembered!
FRED: Do you wanna have dinner tonight?
ELAINE: Hmm. Tonight.
FRED: What, you have other plans?
ELAINE: No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.
[Jerry and George enter a Chinese restaurant, we pick them up in mid-conversation.]
JERRY: ...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code.
GEORGE: Call the Embassy.
JERRY: They're closed.
GEORGE: Why?
JERRY: Bomb threat.
GEORGE: We're in Turkey?
JERRY: Midnight Express, my friend.
GEORGE: My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system.
(Mr. Peterman walks in.)
PETERMAN: You must be Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY: Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.
PETERMAN: J. Peterman.
GEORGE: (grabbing lapels) J. Crew.
JERRY: Well, is Elaine here?
PETERMAN: Oh, Elaine just called, she won't be joining us. Not to worry, I'll tell the maitre'd it'll just be the three bulls.
GEORGE: What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?
JERRY: Without Elaine? What for?
GEORGE: What, is he crazy?
JERRY: We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.
GEORGE: I've got nothing, I-I-I-I'm blank.
JERRY: George, what's the matter with you?
GEORGE: I'm choking!
PETERMAN: Ah, Fong has been most accommodating. Shall we?
JERRY: Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry.
PETERMAN: I understand, no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company. Fong? It will just be two this evening. George, we dine.
[Elaine is waiting on the street.]
ELAINE: (to herself) I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?
[George and Peterman are eating dinner. Peterman is in mid-story. George is disinterested.]
PETERMAN: ...And there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my search. The Gwon-Jaya River market, fabrics and spices traded under a starlit sky. It was there that I discovered the Pamplona beret. Sizes seven-and-a-half through eight-and-three-quarters. Price? Thirty-five dollars.
GEORGE: Howbout sports? Do you follow sports?
[Jerry's apartment, Jerry has his feet up and a big bowl of popcorn beside him on the couch.]
TV ANNOUNCER: It's fourth and inches and the Giants are going for it! You gotta love sports!
[Peterman is driving George home.]
GEORGE: You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.
PETERMAN: Ha ha, nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you about my latest trip to Burma where I discovered a very unusual corduroy.
(The car phone rings, Peterman answers.)
PETERMAN: Peterman here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there. (To George) It's my mother; she's at death's door. I just pray to God we can make it there in time.
(Peterman makes a quick u-turn, pushing George's face into the passenger side window.)
[Elaine is on the phone with Jerry.]
JERRY: I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.
ELAINE: Well, Fred asked me out.
JERRY: Fred?
ELAINE: Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy.
JERRY: You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't remember anything about you.
ELAINE: I am? But that's so sick.
JERRY: That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.
ELAINE: Anyway, so how was the dinner?
JERRY: Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there.
ELAINE: What about Georgie?
JERRY: Nah, he didn't make it.
[Peterman's mother's house. She's in bed; Peterman is consulting with the doctor.]
PETERMAN: Doctor, how is she?
DOCTOR: She's too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice.
PETERMAN: Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama.
(She looks off in George's direction.)
GEORGE: I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son.
[Peterman's mother's apartment. George is sleeping in a chair with a coat covering him. Peterman wakes him up.]
PETERMAN: Shake off the dew, my friend.
GEORGE: Yeah. What time is it?
PETERMAN: It's morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us a pot of coffee, George. Watch her, won't you?
GEORGE: Who?
PETERMAN: Momma. Just talk to her, George. The doctor seems to think it helps.
(Peterman leaves, George attempts conversation.)
GEORGE: Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fiancé, you know, we, uh, we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a relief!
MRS. PETERMAN: Bosco. Bosco.
GEORGE: Oh, shhh.
MRS. PETERMAN: (sitting up) Bosco!
PETERMAN (from another room) Momma? George" Quiet, quiet! It's a secret.
MRS. PETERMAN: Bosco! Bosco! Bosco!
GEORGE: Shut up! Shut up!
(Peterman runs in.)
PETERMAN: Momma! What are you trying to say?
MRS. PETERMAN: Bosco.
(Mrs. Peterman falls back in bed and closes her eyes.)
PETERMAN: She's gone. Bosco?
(Peterman looks at George, who shrugs.)
[George and Jerry are in Jerry's apartment.]
GEORGE: You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant.
JERRY: I did not bail out on you.
GEORGE: Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?
JERRY: Why didn't you come up with your own?
GEORGE: I froze. I think I'm losing it.
JERRY: Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?
GEORGE: No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there.
(Kramer enters.)
GEORGE: Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.
JERRY: Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?
GEORGE: I am not giving you my code.
KRAMER: I'll bet I can guess it.
GEORGE: Pssh. Yeah. Right.
KRAMER: Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?
GEORGE: Huh?
KRAMER: You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet tooth.
GEORGE: Get out of here.
KRAMER: Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the cocoa bean.
GEORGE: I'm leaving.
KRAMER: (building up steam as George bolts for the door) No, and only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you!
GEORGE: I gotta go.
KRAMER: If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!
GEORGE: Shut up!
KRAMER: Nestlé's Quik!
GEORGE: Shut up!
[Elaine and George are at the funeral.]
GEORGE: What was that?
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?
ELAINE: I got a date.
(Mr. Peterman walks up.)
ELAINE: Oh, Mr. Peterman.
PETERMAN: Oh, Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been trying to communicate something, a legacy, a dying wish perhaps.
GEORGE: Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy person.
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.
PETERMAN: You do?
GEORGE: Uh, yes, actually we-we both do.
ELAINE: I have a personal commitment.
GEORGE: Well, personal, I mean, we both uh...
PETERMAN: What is it?
ELAINE: I'm speaking at a women's' rights conference.
GEORGE: Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference.
PETERMAN: I don't believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you to stop by.
ELAINE: My pleasure.
PETERMAN: Fortunately, I still have George here to help me through this.
(Elaine leaves.)
PETERMAN: You know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor that momma had taken a lover. Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.
[Kramer busts in to Jerry's apartment, Jerry is putting on a jacket.]
KRAMER: Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me?
JERRY: Fire station?
KRAMER: Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world!
JERRY: Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.
KRAMER: Oh, so he took you back.
JERRY: Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.
KRAMER: Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.
JERRY: No I didn't.
[Kramer is at the fire station, talking with the Captain.]
CAPTAIN: Well, Mr. Kramer, your list of short cuts is most impressive.
KRAMER: Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show.
CAPTAIN: Mr. Kramer, just about every week some brash young hothead like yourself saunters in here talking about faster routes and snazzier colors for the trucks, well, fact is we feel things are fine the way they are.
[Jerry is back at Leapin' Larry's.]
JERRY: Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.
LEAPIN' LARRY: Water under the bridge. Come on, I never did get a chance to show you around the store.
JERRY: Oh sure.
(Jerry stands up to find his leg is asleep.)
JERRY: Uh, again? (Limping towards the door) I'll be right there.
(Jerry stomps his foot on the floor a few times before he leaves, he accidentally bumps a paint can which knocks over a can of flammable liquid which spills onto some exposed electrical wires causing a fire.)
[Back at the fire station, the alarm is ringing.]
DISPATCHER: Attention Company 390, structure fire at Leapin' Larry's Appliance Warehouse.
KRAMER: Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown. You gotta take Amsterdam.
CAPTAIN: Stay out of this, Kramer.
(Kramer sees the firemen slide down the pole and he gives it a try. As he lands he bumps one of the firemen into the truck, then to the floor in a daze.)
KRAMER: Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?
FIREMAN (groggy) I drive the back of the truck.
(Kramer's face lights up.)
KRAMER: Well, you'd better take it easy.
(Kramer grabs a coat and helmet and heads towards the back of the truck.)
[Elaine and Fred are having dinner.]
FRED: Sorry about the other night but my mother called, she couldn't find her pills. I had to go into Brooklyn to help her find her pills, and they were right there in the medicine cabinet. Could you believe that?
ELAINE: Huh.
FRED: The worst part is getting from the subway station to the house. There's no transportation...
ELAINE: (to herself) What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him...
FRED: ...I could have taken a cab but if my mother saw me pull up in a cab, she'd start yelling at me, "Freddy! What are taking a cab for? It's so expensive!" She's out of her mind. Eventually, you'll meet her.
[George and Peterman are sitting beside the casket.]
PETERMAN: Bosco. Bosco. Bosco.
(A woman rushes in and shouts: There's a big fire down the street, the whole block is going up in flames! Peterman gets up and runs towards the door, he stops and looks back. George is still sitting on the couch, looking up and shaking his head.
PETERMAN: George!
[Inside the speeding fire engine.]
CAPTAIN: Gonna make a left onto Broadway.
KRAMER; (over the radio) No, I would advise against that.
CAPTAIN: Who is this?
(Quick cut to Kramer driving the back of the fire truck.)
KRAMER: It's Kramer!
CAPTAIN: Kramer?! What the hell are you doing back there?
KRAMER: DeSoto's down, but Cosmo's got the caboose.
[Outside Leapin' Larry's. Jerry is helping bring out appliances as smoke pours from the building. A woman approaches Jerry.]
WOMAN: How did this start?
JERRY: Beats me.
LEAPIN' LARRY: Where the hell's the fire department? I'm gonna lose the whole store!
[Cut back to Kramer on the truck.]
CAPTAIN: Kramer, get the hell off of there. You're not trained to operate this equipment!
MAN ON THE STREET: Hey, Kramer!
KRAMER (waving) Hey!
[Cut back to Leapin' Larry's.]
LEAPIN' LARRY: Try the scanner, see if you can pick up anything.
(Jerry turns on the scanner.)
CAPTAIN: What are you doing, Kramer?! You're all over the road!
KRAMER: Don't worry, Cap, I can handle it!
JERRY: Kramer?
[Cut to Kramer losing control of the truck.]
CAPTAIN: You're losing control! Hard right! Hard right!
[Cut to Jerry holding the scanner. he hears screaming, a crashing sound, and then static.]
JERRY: Ah, that's a shame.
[George and Peterman lead a group of people down a smoke filled block.]
PETERMAN: The fire will eat up this entire block!
(They come upon an ATM vestibule.)
PETERMAN: Look, there's a man in there. Get out of there, you're in danger!
MAN: But my sleeve, it's stuck in the machine, it ate my card!
PETERMAN: George, give me your ATM card!
GEORGE: I don't have my ATM card.
PETERMAN: George, you're obviously lying, anyone can see that!
(George pulls out his wallet, Peterman grabs the card, fits it into the slot and tries the door.)
PETERMAN: It's jammed! I'll slide it under the door,
(The man grabs the card and slams it into the machine.)
MAN: Now give me your code!
GEORGE: What?! Why?
MAN: The machine won't open without the code!
PETERMAN: George, give him your code!
GEORGE: But I-I-I-
PETERMAN: George, there's no time! Tell him your code! Shout out your code, man!!
MAN: The code!! The code!!
[George and Jerry are watching TV at George's, Susan walks in and drops some mail on the coffee table.]
SUSAN: Hi. Here's your cash, George.
GEORGE: Hm. Thanks.
SUSAN: And here's your card back. Anyone for Bosco?
JERRY: Oh my god. Look at this.
GEORGE: Hm?
JERRY: It's the new J. Peterman catalog. Look.
(Jerry hands the catalog to George.)
GEORGE: The Rogue's Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little secret. Short, devious, balding. his name was Costanza. He killed my mother.
[Opening Monologue]
I'd like to know when Tic-Tac-Toe became the Pound sign, that's what I'd like to know. Why don't they call it what it really is -- "Leave your numeric message now and then press Archie's head." And what is that redial button? Let's face it -- you're either going to get the person, the machine or they have call waiting. Who is redialing and redialing? This is like the harassment key for people in a fight, you know.
(Jerry holds his right hand up to the side of his face, thumb and pinky extended like a phone receiver)
"Hey I'm not through --" CLICK. Blulululululu.
"You can't do that to me --" CLICK. Blulululululu.
"And another thing --" CLICK. Blulululululu.
[Exterior daylight shot of Jerry's brick apartment building, then inside.]
GEORGE: Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you and me?
JERRY: Well, what do you mean?
GEORGE: Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?
JERRY: Well I think that's pretty obvious.
GEORGE: Yeah. Me too.
(Elaine enters carrying a cup of coffee)
JERRY: Hey Elaine.
ELAINE: Hey.
JERRY: Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here. (pointing up and down at George)
ELAINE: You mean in a real Fight Fight?
JERRY: Mona a Baldo .
ELAINE: George.
GEORGE: Ah-Ha! (he turns and walks over to the refrigerator)
JERRY: Why?
ELAINE: George fights dirty. (she sips her coffee)
JERRY: Really? What would you do?
GEORGE: Pull hair, Poke eyes, Groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do. (he opens a blue bottled beverage)
JERRY: Hmm.
ELAINE: So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met.
JERRY: I'm sorry.
ELAINE: George?
GEORGE: Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?
ELAINE: There's nobody I can go with.
(Kramer enters)
ELAINE: You know what. I don't have one female friend left.
KRAMER: Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you.
ELAINE: Thank you.
KRAMER: So Jerry, (smacks hands and rubs palms together) What time we going to the movies?
JERRY: Ah, how about 8:30?
KRAMER: Saddle up and ride. (opens the fridge and pulls out some food -- takes a big bite)
JERRY: You want to get something to eat first?
KRAMER: (mumbling with full mouth) No, I'm good.
GEORGE: I wonder if, ah, Susan ... (picks up the phone from the coffee table, then decides not to call) No. I better just go. (claps hands) heh. All right! See ya. (grabs his rain coat from the hook by the door and rushes out)
KRAMER: There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, who's afraid of a woman . (voice get high-pitched for the last line)
JERRY: Hey, why don't cha ask Susan?
ELAINE: George's Susan?
JERRY: Yeah.
ELAINE: Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. (smacks her forehead with hand) Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, I'll see you guys. Huh. (rushes out the door.)
KRAMER: That's gunna be trouble.
JERRY: Why?
KRAMER: Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then?
(Kramer raises his hands into the air and slowly brings them together in an explosion. He's holding some food in one hand, so when his hands come into contact food flies all over)
KRAMER: Ka shha shha shha Pkooo (exploding sound)
[Camera fades from the apt. to the Paragon Movie Theater. Jerry and Kramer wait outside in a line to buy tickets.]
KRAMER: Did I tell you I'm getting a new telephone number?
JERRY: How come?
KRAMER: Whew, chicks man. Too many chicks know my number.
(Jerry looks at Kramer, raises his eyebrows with an expression that says "really?")
RAMON: (recognizes Jerry) Hey Jerry. How are you Mr. Backstroke?
JERRY: Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined.
KRAMER: Oh, yeah.
RAMON: So you know what happened don't chu?
JERRY: No what?
RAMON: I got fired.
JERRY: Really?
RAMON: Yeah, said I put too much chlorine in the pool.
JERRY: Ahh.
RAMON: Hey well, ah, stay out of the deep end, eh.
JERRY: OK, see you later.
KRAMER: What's in the deep end?
[Night exterior of George's apartment building, then inside. Susan sits on the couch reading.]
(Telephone rings)
GEORGE: Hello?
ELAINE: Hey George.
GEORGE: Hey Elainie. What's going on?
ELAINE: (sitting up in bed) Nothing much, um. Can I talk to Susan
GEORGE: Ha, Yeah right, hang on, I'll ah, I'll get her for you. he, he, he, he. Seriously, what's up?
ELAINE: No, George really. Can I talk to Susan?
GEORGE: Susan, why?
ELAINE: Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.
GEORGE: Oh, I don't think you want to do that.
ELAINE: Why not?
GEORGE: Well what would be the point of that?
(Susan, hearing her name glances over at George)
ELAINE: George, are you going to put her on the phone?
GEORGE: Where did this come from all of a sudden?
ELAINE: George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not?
GEORGE: I really think I should have been consulted about this.
(George takes the phone from his ear and walks over to the couch and hands the phone to Susan)
GEORGE: Here ... something.
SUSAN: Hello? (with hesitant surprise) Oh, that sounds great. I love that sort of stuff.
(George stands behind the couch, arms crossed with his right hand clenched up to his mouth. He takes off his glasses, puts his left hand just above his eyes and rubs them in disbelief and walks out of the room.)
[Night exterior of a busy NYC street. Large lit advertising signs for Panasonic, JVC and a couple of McDonalds "Golden Arches" are visible. Then to the inside of the movie theater.]
KRAMER: You want to sit here?
JERRY: Yeah. (Kramer sits in the seat next to Jerry) Uh, uh, oh, oh, Over there. (points to the next seat over)
KRAMER: Why?
JERRY: Little buffer zone.
KRAMER: (Quietly) Buffer zone (Kramer moves to the other seat)
JERRY: Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other?
KRAMER: No. You got a point.
JERRY: All right.
KRAMER: I can't ...
JERRY: What are you doing?
KRAMER: Well these seats have no lumbar.
JERRY: Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.
(Ramon is looking for a seat. He's carrying a drink, a bunch of napkins, and a huge bucket of popcorn)
KRAMER: We are talking.
JERRY: Pretend it's interesting.
KRAMER: So, ah then, I ah had to kill him and ah, well the police are still looking for me.
JERRY: That's shocking, but sounds ...
RAMON: Hey, hi Jerry.
JERRY: Oh, hey Ramon.
RAMON: Hey, hey, I took a bunch of napkins. You want some?
JERRY: Oh, no thanks. (turns back to Kramer)
RAMON: Hey, ahhh, is this seat taken?
(Ramon proceeds to sit down between Kramer and Jerry)
JERRY: No.
(As Ramon sits down, he bumps into Kramer and startles him. Jerry looks like he can't believe Ramon sat down. Ramon is bobbing his head front to back with his neck, like sitting there worked out pretty good)
[Exterior of Jerry's apartment building then inside where Jerry and George are talking.]
JERRY: And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now.
GEORGE: By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today?
JERRY: No why?
GEORGE: (sighs) She called Susan last night.
JERRY: Oh yeah, I know.
GEORGE: How do you know?
JERRY: Well it was my idea.
GEORGE: Your idea?
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: Wha'd you do that for?
JERRY: She was looking for someone to go to the show with.
GEORGE: Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now?
JERRY: World's collide. (points at George)
GEORGE: Whe ... Well yeah!
JERRY: Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact with --
GEORGE: YES! It Blows Up! If you knew that, what did you tell Elaine for?
JERRY: I didn't know. Kramer told me about the worlds.
GEORGE: You couldn't figure out the "World's Theory" for yourself? It's just common sense. Anybody knows, ya gotta keep your worlds apart. (gesturing with hands going outward)
JERRY: Yeah, I guess I slipped up.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hey.
GEORGE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
GEORGE: He knows the worlds theory.
KRAMER: What is it blowing up?
GEORGE: Ha! (grabs his coat and exits the apartment)
(Telephone rings - Kramer pulls a cordless phone from his pocket)
KRAMER: Cosmo, go. No, no, na, na. (he pushes the end button and pushes the antenna down) Boy this new telephone number's driving me crazy -- wrong numbers, every five minutes.
JERRY: What is it?
KRAMER: Well it's 555-3455.
JERRY: 555-3455.
KRAMER: Yeah.
JERRY: (picks up the phone on the coffee table) "555-3455." Well wait a second, don't you see that's 555-FILK.
KRAMER: What's Filk?
JERRY: Filk's nothing, but 555-FILM is Movie Phone.
KRAMER: Oh Movie Phone.
JERRY: Yes, so people are just dialing it by mistake and getting you.
KRAMER: So, I'm Filk?
JERRY: You're Filk.
KRAMER: Oh, Mama.
[Susan and Elaine are walking down the sidewalk.]
ELAINE: Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the 19th Amendment party. Hnuh. Eye yye yye.
SUSAN: Oh whoo. Quite the DèColletage for a suffragette.
ELAINE: Ha, ha, ha, ha, well it must have been one hell of a party.
SUSAN: Whoo.
ELAINE: Ha, ha, ha, ha.
SUSAN: Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you.
ELAINE: What?
SUSAN: Ehahh, forget it.
ELAINE: What? You can tell me. I'll put it in the vault.
SUSAN: The vault?
ELAINE: Mm-Hmm.
[Exterior shot of Physique (Jerry's health club) then inside to the men's locker room where Jerry is putting some clothes in a gym bag. Some men are in the background talking.]
PAUL - Locker room Attendant #1: Oy, Mr. Seinfeld. We heard you went to the movies with Ramon.
JERRY: Oh, well, I didn't actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into him there. (putting on coat)
DUSTIN - Locker room Attendant #2: It's a good thing he has friends like you to cheer him up.
PAUL: Tell him to call us.
DUSTIN: Tell him, Dustin says, "Hello."
JERRY: All right, I gotta go.
PAUL: To see Ramon?
(Paul, with his eyes wide open looking at Jerry. Dustin stares off the other direction, laughing to himself)
[Exterior of Jerry's apartment building, then inside Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY: What else did you two do?
ELAINE: Oh, I don't know, you know, girlie stuff.
JERRY: Ah, so, ah, flower shows and, shopping for pretty bows, and then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight?
(Elaine stands there for a good 6 seconds with arms crossed, blank expression, just looking at Jerry)
ELAINE: That's really what you think girls do, isn't it?
JERRY: Yes, I do. (very serious)
ELAINE: All rightee. (turns and walks to the bathroom)
JERRY: Hey you know George isn't to happy, ahh, about your new friendship.
ELAINE: Yeah? Well I don't really give a Sh... (closing the bathroom door)
(Kramer enters and leaves the door open)
KRAMER: Hey man, what's going on?
JERRY: Hey.
(Telephone rings)
KRAMER: Ooh, here we go. (pulls a cordless phone from his pocket) Yeah hello. Yeah, no, no, no, hold on.
(Kramer walks over to the table, opens the newspaper to the movie section)
KRAMER: Yeah, Cupid's Rifle -- 8:30, Sony Lincoln Square. Yeah, no, no, no, no problem, yeah.
(Kramer hangs up the cordless and pushes the antenna back in, puts the phone in his pocket)
JERRY: You're looking up movies for people now?
KRAMER: I got time.
(Telephone rings)
KRAMER: And this. (pulls out the cordless phone from his pocket) Cosmo here. Yeah, un-huh, no, no, no, no, I'll help. Yeah, Firestorm's good. I saw it yesterday. Yeah well my buddy Jerry , ah, he's seen it twice. You want to talk to him? Here -- (holds the phone out to Jerry)
JERRY: (shaking his head no) No Kramer I don't want to talk to him.
(Jerry is backing away, as Kramer attempt to foist the phone on to Jerry, but he will not take it -- Kramer continues to try and get Jerry to take the phone from him)
** Continuity Error -- During this part of the scene, we clearly see Kramer's right hand holding the phone, his left hand is empty. This sequence is shot from several camera angles. At the end of the sequence, Kramer is holding the folded newspaper in his left hand -- he did not reach over to pick up the paper -- so this is obviously a Continuity Error **
KRAMER: Just, just tell him about the picture. What's the matter with you? Stop it. (puts the phone back to his ear) Yes, are you still there? Look I'm sorry about that. All right there's an 8:30 and a 10:15showing.
(Kramer walks out the open door and into his apt. with the newspaper. Elaine walks back into the living room, wondering what just happened, she gestures towards Kramer as he exits)
(Intercom buzzes)
JERRY: Oh that's George. (presses the intercom button) Yeah?
RAMON: (Hey it's Ramon)
JERRY: What?
RAMON: (Hey, It's Ramon Jerry. I'm coming up)
JERRY: (to Ramon) Oh. Okay. (to Elaine) Wh, what is he doing here?
ELAINE: Who? Who is Ramon?
JERRY: He's the pool guy.
ELAINE: What pool guy?
JERRY: Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here.
ELAINE: Yeah, no problem.
----------------------------------------------------
** Inconsistency in reality -- Ramon shows up at Jerry's door, 8 seconds from the time when Jerry stops pressing the intercom buzzer. Either Ramon would have to run up 5 flights of stairs incredibly fast (he does not appear out of breath) or those are some very fast elevators.
-- and we know from a Episode 6 The Ex-Girlfriend that Elaine complains about the slow elevators in Jerry's apt. building. **
Episode 6 The Ex-Girlfriend
ELAINE: You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.
JERRY: Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.
----------------------------------------------------
RAMON: Hee hey, hey Jerry (claps hands and points both index fingers at him) How are you, crazy guy?
JERRY: Hey. So, ah, Ramon this is my friend Elaine.
ELAINE: Yeah and I was just leaving. Bye-bye Jerry. (smiling as she closes the door. Jerry looks at her like he can not believe she left him on his own)
JERRY: So, ah, what are you doing around here Ramon?
RAMON: Well, I was in the neighborhood. I figured I'd check you out.
JERRY: Ah, actually, I ka, kinda had some things to do.
RAMON: Oh, oh yeah. Wha? Where you going?
JERRY: Ah, just, you know, I don't know. Stuff, I gotta do. (grabs coat and throws it over his shoulder)
RAMON: Hey that's cool. I'm up for some stuff
JERRY: All right.
(They head for the door)
[Moving subway cars blur by, then inside the subway car where Jerry sits next to Ramon]
RAMON: So get this. I get down there, and right away, I see the drain is clogged. I mean it's obvious. Can you believe it?
JERRY: All right Ramon, I'm going to get going.
(Subway train stops and door opens)
JERRY: I think we should separate here actually.
RAMON: What are you trying to say Jerry?
JERRY: Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more.
RAMON: Oh I see. It's cause I clean pools, right?
JERRY: That has nothing to do with it.
RAMON: You su -- (no audio) (through the moving subway window, Ramon is swearing and pointing at Jerry)
[Exterior of George's apartment building then inside his apartment.]
SUSAN: Yeah, we got along real well.
GEORGE: You know, uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't cha? Something strange about a woman who's friends are all men.
SUSAN: Yeah, I know. We talked all about that.
GEORGE: You talked all about that?
SUSAN: Oh yeah. Elaine opened up her vault.
GEORGE: Did you just say vault?
SUSAN: Yeah, why? Did I use it wrong?
GEORGE: You got that from Elaine.
SUSAN: Yeah. So what?
GEORGE: Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on?
SUSAN: I don't know. Anyway I thought we'd all go to a movie on Friday.
GEORGE: We'd all go to movie on Friday?
SUSAN: Yeah.
GEORGE: This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting upset!
[Inside Jerry's apartment -- Jerry sits on the couch listening to George.]
GEORGE: Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him, Ceases to Exist! You see, right now, I have Relationship George, but there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with -- Movie George, Coffee shop George, Liar George, Bawdy George.
JERRY: I, I love that George.
GEORGE: Me Too! And he's Dying Jerry! If Relationship George walks through this door, he will Kill Independent George! A George, divided against itself, Cannot Stand!
(Elaine enters)
GEORGE: You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you?
ELAINE: George I don't even want to get --
GEORGE: You know what word Susan used last night? Hnuh. Vault! hu,
hu, hu.
ELAINE: So?
GEORGE: She got that from you!
ELAINE: Well, I didn't tell here to say it.
GEORGE: Is she the only girl in the whole world? Why can't you get find your own girl?
ELAINE: I Like Her!
GEORGE: You see (to Jerry). You see. You see what I'm talking about. It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen. (exits -- slamming the door)
JERRY: So you want to catch a movie later?
ELAINE: Ahh, yeah, sure.
JERRY: I don't have a paper though.
ELAINE: Hmm. (picks up the phone and dials)
(Ring)
KRAMER: Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. Brought to you by the New York Times and Hot 97. Coming to theaters this Friday ... Kevin Bacon, Susan Sarandon -- "You've got to get me over that mountain!" "Now" (bang, bang) "AHHHHHHHHHH" There is no place higher than ... Mountain High . Rated R. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press 1.
ELAINE: Kramer, is that you?
KRAMER: Elaine?
ELAINE: Uh, what time does Chow Fun start?
KRAMER: I don't know.
[Exterior of the Physique health club, then inside to the men's locker room.]
RAMON: Well, well. Look who's here.
JERRY: Ramon, what are you doing here? You could get in trouble.
RAMON: No, I don't think so Jerry. You see they gave me my job back.
JERRY: What?
RAMON: I'm a pool boy ... again.
JERRY: Look Ramon, about the other day. I'm sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway.
RAMON: Do you?
JERRY: What happened to all the towels?
RAMON: Oh, ah, I guess they must have disappeared. (walks away)
(Newman rushes up to Jerry)
NEWMAN: Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit the jackpot! (holding a large stack of towels, Newman pats his face with the top one) Ha, ha, ha.
(Jerry extends his arms, making a vain attempt at a reach for a towel as Newman walks away)
[Exterior of Elaine's building. Elaine and Jerry walk down the steps and on to the sidewalk.]
JERRY: It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ...
ELAINE: Uh-huh.
JERRY: And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone.
ELAINE: Uhh, so frustrating!
JERRY: Tell me about it.
ELAINE: Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
JERRY: You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
ELAINE: Yeah.
JERRY: I'm meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.
ELAINE: Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting.
(Elaine walks off, while Jerry stands there contemplating the upcoming ramifications)
[Elaine and Jerry enter Monk's coffee shop as Susan sits across the booth from Kramer.]
SUSAN: Hey! Elaine! Jerry. Over here!
KRAMER: There they are.
SUSAN: Yeah, look who I ran into.
KRAMER: Hey.
ELAINE: Yeah. (sits down next to Susan)
KRAMER: Yeah.
ELAINE: Ahh.
(Jerry stands a few paces from the booth, looking around for George, and feeling uncomfortable about the upcoming events)
KRAMER: Come on Jerry. Aren't you going to join us?
JERRY: Ah, you know. I'm supposed to meet, eh, someone -- I'll, I'll wait for them outside. (walks towards the door)
KRAMER: Yeah, wait here. Come on, sit down. What's the matter with you?
JERRY: This is gonna to be ugly. (quietly)
(Jerry sits down next to Kramer)
SUSAN: What's that Jerry?
JERRY: (coughing) I said, boy am I ugly.
(George enters the coffee shop)
SUSAN: Oh, hey, hey, Georgie boy, over here.
(George walks in and stops, looking at the four of them sitting in the booth. He nods his head and extends his arm in acknowledgment, nods his head again, he lightly claps his hands and walks up to the table)
GEORGE: One, two ... three, four.
(extending his arm and counting to Elaine, Susan, Kramer and Jerry, who he puts his hand under Jerry's chin and then makes a fist and presses it to Jerry's cheek)
GEORGE: Ha Ho! (he turns and walks out the door)
SUSAN: Hey George!
JERRY: We'll pull up another chair.
New scene.
Exterior of Reggie's diner, then inside where George sits alone in a
booth. He eats in silence. A man sits at the counter, sipping coffee.
[Exterior shot of the Physique health club, then inside to the pool. Jerry is swimming while Ramon is cleaning the pool with a large squeegee on a long pole.]
JERRY: I see you there Ramon.
(Ramon jabs a little bit at Jerry with the squeegee)
JERRY: Hey, l'll just keep swimming. Hey, hey. I'm not done. I know what you're up to Ramon. Because I'm a member here, this is my place to swim.
(Ramon pushes the squeegee out into Jerry's swim path -- Jerry grabs the squeegee pole and they struggle in a push-pull match)
JERRY: Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it.
(Ramon loses his balance and Jerry pulls him into the pool)
RAMON: Oh.
(Newman runs towards the pool in one of those old time bathing suits)
NEWMAN: Olly, olly, oxen, free!
(It looks like Newman tries to do a cannonball into the pool, filmed in slow motion. Ramon looks up with a stunned look on his face, seeing Newman as he jumps into the pool on top of him.)
JERRY: (NO!)
(Camera fade to Ramon, lying unconscious on the tile pool deck. Newman and Jerry are kneeling over him.)
JERRY: I think he's gonna need, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
NEWMAN: Mouth-to-mouth?
JERRY: Yeah.
NEWMAN: Huh.
JERRY: Well? Go ahead.
NEWMAN: You go.
JERRY: You knocked him out.
NEWMAN: Yeah, but you pulled him in.
JERRY: Come on Newman. Do it.
NEWMAN: Nah.
JERRY: He might die.
NEWMAN: Yeah. Maybe.
[Night exterior of George's apartment building, then inside where Susan and Elaine are sitting and talking.]
ELAINE: (on the phone to) Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater. (hangs up the phone) OK, next showings at 9:00, we can't wait any longer.
SUSAN: Elaine, where could he be? It's not like George to just disappear.
ELAINE: Look, let's just leave him a note, okay?
SUSAN: Oh, I don't know.
ELAINE: Oh, come on, come on, come on. (picks up pad of paper and writes) "George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry." Love?
SUSAN: Yeah.
ELAINE: "Love ... Susan."
[Camera fade to Elaine, Susan and Jerry outside the Paragon movie theater. It's night as they wait in line to buy tickets.]
JERRY: So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouth-to-mouth.
ELAINE: He could have died
JERRY: Yeah, it was a gamble.
SUSAN: Why didn't you give him mouth-to-mouth?
JERRY: Ah. (makes face)
ELAINE: How can you possibly show your face there again?
JERRY: Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know, we can't go anywhere near there.
(they move up to the ticket window)
ELAINE: Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child. (looking towards Jerry)
[Night exterior of George's apartment building, then inside where George finds the note.]
GEORGE: What the hell is this? "George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry." With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great! (dials phone) Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go with Jerry.
(Rings)
KRAMER: Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press one.
GEORGE: Come on. Come on.
KRAMER: Using your touch-tone keypad, please enter the first three letters of the movie title, now.
(George presses 3 keys)
KRAMER: You've selected ... Agent Zero? If that's correct, press one.
GEORGE: What?
KRAMER: Ah, you've selected ... Brown-Eyed Girl? If this is correct, press one.
(George looks baffled)
KRAMER: Why don't you just tell me the name of the movie you've selected.
GEORGE: Chunnel ?
KRAMER: To find the theater nearest you, please enter your five digit zip-code, now.
(George enters his zip-code)
KRAMER: Why don't you just tell me where you want to see the movie?
GEORGE: Lowes Paragon, 84th and Broadway.
KRAMER: (picks up paper) Chunnel , is playing at the Paragon 84th Street cinema in the main theater at 9:30 PM.
GEORGE: Yeah, now I gotcha! (hangs up the phone and rushes out the door)
KRAMER: It's also playing in theater number two at 9:00.
[Night exterior of United Artists Theater with a busy street in the foreground -- taxi's drive by. Then inside to a darkened theater, George, in the isle, searches for Jerry, Elaine and Susan. He's trying to be quiet and still get their attention.]
GEORGE: Jerry ... Where are you? I know you like to sit back here. Elaine! Susan!
MOVIE PATRON: SHH!
(from the movie we hear this dialogue: "The English Channel Tunnel, Chunnel, runs 32.3 miles, with two openings. One here, in England and another one here, in France. That's all we got. Thank you for your time gentlemen. Can I ask you a question Mr. McKittrick." -- it's a bit hard to hear the movie dialogue, as we are supposed to be focused on George, but I was able to make out most of it)
[Cut to Susan, Elaine and Jerry watching Chunnel in the theater next door. Jerry is eating popcorn while Elaine sips a drink and eats a bit of popcorn]
JERRY: I can't figure out what's going on here. I can't follow the plot. Why did they kill that guy? I thought he was with them?
SUSAN: No, no. That's not the guy. That's a different guy.
(Susan looks irritated at Jerry and Elaine's talking)
JERRY: What is he doing in the Chunnel?
SUSAN: Would you two, Please?
(movie voice - clearly it's Larry David's voice) ( Everybody out of the Chunnel! Everybody out! )
(Elaine and Jerry stop eating, sink back into their seats and look at each other, with silent expressions that say "what is her problem.")
(again, from the movie we hear this dialogue: "Let me tell you something about the Chunnel, Mr. Thane. That our only freeway is adept. (inaudible) Elaine Brookstone will get the money bag (inaudible) Not as long as I have these long stickers. Find him and Kill him! I don't care if we have to turn this Chunnel upside down! Find Him! Everybody out of the Chunnel! Everybody out! The Chunnel's gonna blow! AHHHHHH (Explosion)"
** this time it's really tough to make all of it out, so there are some inaudible parts, but I tried to pick up most of it)
[back to George in the other theater. He stands at the front of the theater, the movie screen behind and above him. He is still trying to find Jerry, Elaine and Susan.]
GEORGE: Susan! Jerry! Where are you? I know you're there! Answer me!
MOVIE PATRON: (Hey, sit down!)
GEORGE: Hey. Hey. Answer me! Come on, show yourselves!
MOVIE PATRON: (Hey, we're trying to watch a movie here!)
GEORGE: Drink your soda! Come on! I know you're there, laughing at me. Laughing and lying and laughing! I had to go to Reggies, Jerry! Reggies!
MOVIE PATRON: (Move it off of there!)
GEORGE: Where are you!
2nd MOVIE PATRON: (Hey are you sure you got the right theater?)
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chunnel . Susan!
2nd MOVIE PATRON: (It's playing in two theaters.)
GEORGE: Two theaters?
2nd MOVIE PATRON: (Yeah, there's a 9:00 too.)
GEORGE: Oh. Sorry.
(A large bucket of popcorn is thrown at George. He tries to deflect it, but the popcorn flies all over)
(once again, from the movie we hear this dialogue: "There's something else, your ex-wife. Alexandra? She's in France, I'm telling ya. No, she's in the Chunnel. The Chunnel? No! Mr. President, I'm sorry to disturb you. What is it? There's something about the Chunnel. Oh?" (inaudible) And that means your daughter is in the Chunnel. Somewhere between France and ... (inaudible)"
** Again, it's really tough to make all of it out, so there are some inaudible parts, but I tried to pick up most of it)
[Elaine, Susan and Jerry exit the theater.]
ELAINE: I thought that was pretty good, huh?
JERRY: Wha'd you think Susan?
SUSAN: Oh, I don't know. I couldn't hear anything. You, you talked the whole movie.
ELAINE: Oh, well come on. You want to go grab a bite to eat?
JERRY: Yeah.
SUSAN: Ah, no. I don't think so.
ELAINE: Why not?
SUSAN: Well you know, all you guys ever do is sit around the coffee shop talking, sit around Jerry's apartment talking. Frankly, I don't know how you can stand it. I'll see you.
(Susan turns to walk away, but stops and looks at George being escorted out of the theater by two ushers. He struggles to try and stay inside the theater, but they forcefully remove him. Jerry, Elaine and Susan watch as George it escorted out -- he does not see the three of them standing there.)
GEORGE: I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me. Together, laughing and lying.
USHER: Let's go pal.
GEORGE: They're -- They're killing independent George! And they're, they're all in on it! World's are colliding!
(Camera freeze on George with the two ushers)
[Outside Kramer's apartment door: 5B A partial view of a man's face and his hand knocks 3 times on the door.]
MOVIE PHONE GUY: Hello, and welcome to your worst nightmare.
(Kramer, sitting on the couch, reading the paper and eating cereal is obviously startled by the voice at his door)
MOVIE PHONE GUY: (con't) I know your in there, Cosmo Kramer, Apartment 5B. You're in big trouble, Now. You've been sealing my business. If you'd like to do this the easy way, open the door, Now. Or, please select the number of seconds, you'd like to wait, before I break this door down. Please select Now.
(as the Movie Phone Guy talks, Kramer slides off the couch and ducks down under the coffee table, then pops back up with a dazed look.)
[Opening Monologue]
I have a friend, wears eyeglasses, no prescription in the glasses because he thinks it makes him look more intelligent, now why? Why do we think that glasses makes us look more intelligent? Is it from the endless hours of reading and studying and researching that this person supposedly blew out their eyeballs, and that's why they need the glasses? It's just a corrective device. If you see someone with a hearing aid, you don't think, 'Oh, they must have been listening real good...yeah, to a lot of important stuff...' No, they are deaf . They can't hear.
[Jerry and Elaine in a booth at Monk's. Kramer comes over from the counter with a clipboard in his hand.]
KRAMER: Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk.
ELAINE: Is that tomorrow?
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...(gestures to Elaine to sign the form.)
ELAINE (signing): Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS.
KRAMER: Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.
JERRY (signing): It's hard enough living next door.
KRAMER: I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. (gets up) I'll be right back.
(Jerry stands up and gets a bottle of ketchup from the next table.)
ELAINE: New jeans?
JERRY: Yeah.
ELAINE: Still a 31 waist?
JERRY: Yep. Since college. (Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.) Hey, Lena Small's on this list.
ELAINE: Lena Small?
JERRY: Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number.
ELAINE: Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!
JERRY (copying down the number): Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person.
ELAINE: You're a taking person.
JERRY: That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.
ELAINE (warns): She's gonna ask how you got her number.
JERRY: Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.
ELAINE: What's he look like?
JERRY: I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.
ELAINE: You're buying a speedboat?
JERRY: See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. (Elaine laughs.) All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free.
ELAINE: I don't know about that.
JERRY: So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?
ELAINE: Well...
JERRY: Yeah. So you really like this guy.
ELAINE: Very much.
JERRY: How's the...sexual chemistry?
ELAINE: Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today. (Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.)
KRAMER: Are you still on the pill?
ELAINE: Uh, Kramer...
KRAMER: I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum.
ELAINE: The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge.
KRAMER: But wasn't that taken off the market?
ELAINE: Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.
KRAMER: I read it in Wall Street Week ...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.
(Elaine laughs.)
[Jerry on the phone in his apartment.]
JERRY: Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat...
[George and Susan in George's car.]
SUSAN: You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin.
GEORGE: Not as thin as you think.
SUSAN: Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.
GEORGE: The tag, huh?
SUSAN: Mmm-hmm.
GEORGE: Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that.
SUSAN: What are you talking about?
GEORGE: He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.
SUSAN: Oh, how could he be so vain?
GEORGE: Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that.
SUSAN (laughing): Why not?
GEORGE: Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know.
SUSAN: Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell me everything.
GEORGE: Where did you get that from?
SUSAN: Well, we're a couple. It's understood.
GEORGE: I never heard of that.
SUSAN: Well, you've never been a couple.
GEORGE: I've coupled! I've coupled!
SUSAN: Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.
GEORGE: This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!
[George arrives at Jerry's apartment.]
GEORGE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey. What's the matter?
GEORGE: I had a fight with Susan.
JERRY: What about?
GEORGE: Oh...(is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders) ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?
JERRY: I got a date with that girl, Lena.
GEORGE: Lena, how'd you meet her?
JERRY: I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... (Jerry stops, and mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica on the phone at work.)
GEORGE: You met her a few weeks ago, but...?
JERRY (slowly): I didn't call her till today.
GEORGE: So, uh...wanna double?
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.
JERRY: I dunno. (Elaine enters.) Hey.
ELAINE: Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market.
JERRY: So what are you gonna do?
ELAINE: I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.
GEORGE: Just for these sponges?
ELAINE: Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?
GEORGE: I dunno.
ELAINE: You don't know?
GEORGE: I, uh...figure it's something. (Kramer enters.)
JERRY: What are you all out of breath from?
KRAMER (panting): The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.
JERRY: And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.
KRAMER: Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!
JERRY: I got a 31 waist, mister!
KRAMER: Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?
JERRY (proudly): What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers.
[A musical montage of Elaine's "hard-target search" - visiting stores and pharmacies all over town and not finding a sponge anywhere. She ends up at the Pasteur Pharmacy.]
PHARMACIST: Can I help you?
ELAINE (with little hope): Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but...
PHARMACIST: Actually, we have a case left.
ELAINE (excited): A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?
PHARMACIST: Sixty.
ELAINE: Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three.
PHARMACIST: Three.
ELAINE: Make it ten.
PHARMACIST: Ten?
ELAINE: Twenty sponges should be plenty.
PHARMACIST: Did you say twenty?
ELAINE: Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine.
PHARMACIST: Right. So, you're set with twenty-five.
ELAINE: Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
[Jerry and Lena having dinner in a restaurant with George and Susan.]
JERRY: Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.
LENA (smells Jerry's arm): Mmm! Very nice.
JERRY: It's All-Tempa-Cheer.
LENA: I use Planet. It's bio-degradable and doesn't pollute the oceans.
GEORGE: Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.
LENA (to waiter): Can you wrap up all the left-overs on the table, please? I always take the left-overs. I work in a soup kitchen every morning at 6 a.m.
JERRY: They serve soup at 6 a.m.?
LENA: Yeah. That's all they have.
JERRY: Do the bums ever complain? "Soup again?"
GEORGE: I'd get tired of it.
JERRY: How could you not?
LENA: Guess who volunteered last week?
GEORGE: Mick Jagger.
LENA: No. Maya Angelou.
SUSAN: Oh, the poet!
JERRY (to Lena): So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day?
LENA: I don't know.
SUSAN (to Lena): So, did you get to talk to her?
LENA: Talk to who?
JERRY: Is it a lot of cream soups?
SUSAN: Maya Angelou, the poet.
LENA: No, I didn't get the chance.
GEORGE: Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?
(Jerry gives George a surprised look. George looks back, puzzled.)
SUSAN: I'm going to the ladies room.
LENA: I'll go with you. (They leave.)
GEORGE: What are you looking at me like that for?
JERRY: Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'?
GEORGE: What are you talking about?
JERRY: Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.
(George's interest is peaked.)
[George and Susan in the car on the way home.]
SUSAN: Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful!
GEORGE: I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you.
SUSAN: But you told me anyway?
GEORGE: Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule.
SUSAN: Thank you, honey.
GEORGE: So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?
SUSAN: Can we stop by a drug store first?
GEORGE: What for?
SUSAN: I'm out of birth control stuff.
GEORGE: Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? (Pulls over.)
SUSAN: Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in.
GEORGE: Me run in? Why don't you run in?
SUSAN: You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?
GEORGE: Of course I do.
SUSAN: You do? What?
GEORGE: You know. You use the, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
SUSAN: The what?
GEORGE: You know, the uh...(mutters it again.)
SUSAN: Just get me some sponges, please.
GEORGE: Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market.
SUSAN: Off the market? The sponge?
GEORGE: Yeah, so you gotta use something else.
SUSAN: I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!
GEORGE: O.k....(thinks) I think I know where we can get one.
[Jerry approaching his apartment door. He hears the sound of a loud group of people from inside Kramer's place. He knocks on Kramer's door. Kramer answers.]
JERRY: Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?
KRAMER: It's a poker game...(yells to the crowd) And I'm kickin' some serious butt!
JERRY: Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
VOICE FROM POKER GAME: Hey, Kramer - are you in?
KRAMER: Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? Do they look scared?!
JERRY: You're never gonna make it!
(Kramer giggles and returns to the game.)
[Elaine and Billy in Elaine's apartment, kissing passionately on the sofa.]
BILLY: You, uh...you wanna go in the bedroom?
ELAINE: O.k. Hold on just a second. (Gets up and heads to the bathroom. George knocks at the door.)
GEORGE: Elaine? It's me, George. (Elaine opens the door.) Hey, sorry to bother you so late. (To Billy) Hey! How ya doin.' (To Elaine) Uh, did you get any of those sponges?
ELAINE: Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
GEORGE: Well...Susan.
ELAINE: Ah, Susan uses the sponge.
GEORGE: Susan loves the sponge.
ELAINE: Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.
GEORGE: What?
ELAINE: I can't do it. No way, there's no how. (Tries to push George out the door. George resists.)
GEORGE: Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?
ELAINE: Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. (Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.)
GEORGE: Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left.
ELAINE: I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. (Stamps on George's foot and closes the door.) (To Billy) Hold that thought!
(Elaine goes into the bathroom for a sponge, but then stops and reconsiders.)
[Susan talking on the phone with Monica.]
SUSAN: So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list.
(Cut to Monica at home talking on the phone with Susan.)
MONICA: He got her number off an AIDS walk list?
(Cut to Lena at home talking on the phone with Monica.)
LENA: He what?
[Jerry and Lena in Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY: How'd you find out?
LENA: A friend of a friend of a friend of Susan's.
JERRY: George!
LENA: Pardon?
JERRY: Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just -
LENA: It's o.k.! There's nothing to be sorry about. I don't mind.
JERRY: You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
LENA: No, not at all. No problem. (Jerry looks at Lena suspiciously. Lena leaves with all of Kramer's poker buddies, who are filing out of Kramer's apartment.)
KRAMER: Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!
JERRY: You went all night?
KRAMER (shows Jerry his winnings): Jerry, ah? Breakfast on me, huh?
JERRY: Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!
KRAMER: AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. (George enters.) Hey!
JERRY: So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.
GEORGE: Really? How'd she do that?
JERRY: A friend of a friend of Susan's.
GEORGE: My Susan?
JERRY: Why'd you tell her?!
GEORGE: Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!
JERRY: Well you know what this means, don't you?
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: You're cut off, you're out of the loop!
GEORGE: You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!
JERRY: You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
GEORGE: C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again.
JERRY: If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?
GEORGE: Hey, a "hit" is a totally different story.
JERRY: I don't know, George.
GEORGE: So, Lena was upset, huh?
JERRY: You know what? That was the amazing thing.
GEORGE: What, it didn't bother her?
JERRY: No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: She's too good.
GEORGE: Too good...
JERRY: I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!
GEORGE: I see what you mean.
JERRY: I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.
GEORGE: Where's the depravity?
JERRY: No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex.
(Elaine enters.)
JERRY (using Elaine as an example): On the other hand...
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE (to Elaine): Thanks again for last night!
ELAINE: Hey, I didn't even use one.
JERRY: I thought you said it was imminent.
ELAINE: Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy.
JERRY: Sponge-worthy?
ELAINE: Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.
JERRY: But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?
ELAINE: Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em.
GEORGE: You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!
[Kramer signing in at the AIDS walk.]
KRAMER (to organizer at desk): Uh, Cosmo Kramer?
ORGANIZER: Uh...o.k., you're checked in. Here's your AIDS ribbon.
KRAMER: Uh, no thanks.
ORGANIZER: You don't want to wear an AIDS ribbon?
KRAMER: No.
ORGANIZER: But you have to wear an AIDS ribbon.
KRAMER: I have to?
ORGANIZER: Yes.
KRAMER: See, that's why I don't want to.
ORGANIZER: But everyone wears the ribbon. You must wear the ribbon!
KRAMER: You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. (Walks away.)
ORGANIZER: Hey you! Come back here! Come back here and put this on!
[George and Susan in a booth at the coffee shop.]
GEORGE: Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them.
SUSAN: Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms.
GEORGE: Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever.
SUSAN: Just once...for the make-up sex.
GEORGE: Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that.
SUSAN: Come on, just once?
GEORGE: No, no...I hate the condom.
SUSAN: Why?
GEORGE: I can never get the package open in time.
SUSAN: Well, you just tear it open.
GEORGE: It's not that easy. It's like "Beat The Clock," there's a lot of pressure there.
[Kramer in the AIDS walk.]
WALKER #1: Hey, where's your ribbon?
KRAMER: Oh, I don't wear the ribbon.
WALKER #2: Oh, you don't wear the ribbon? Aren't you against AIDS?
KRAMER: Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon.
WALKER #3: Who do you think you are?
WALKER #1: Put the ribbon on!
WALKER #2: Hey, Cedric! Bob! This guy won't wear a ribbon! (Cedric and Bob turn around and glare at Kramer.)
BOB: Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? (Kramer is frightened.)
[Elaine and Billy in her apartment.]
ELAINE: So, you think you're sponge-worthy?
BILLY: Yes, I think I'm sponge-worthy. I think I'm very sponge-worthy.
ELAINE: Run down your case for me again...?
BILLY: Well, we've gone out several times, we obviously have a good rapport. I own a very profitable electronics distributing firm. I eat well. I exercise. Blood tests - immaculate. And if I can speak frankly, I'm actually quite good at it.
ELAINE: You going to do something about your sideburns?
BILLY: Yeah, I told you...I'm going to trim my sideburns.
ELAINE: And the bathroom in your apartment?
BILLY: Cleaned it this morning.
ELAINE: The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned?
BILLY: Everything, yeah. It's spotless.
ELAINE: Alright, let's go. (They head for the bedroom.)
[Jerry arrives at Lena's apartment.]
JERRY: Hi.
LENA: Hi! Hey, look at this - I just got a citation in the mail for my work with shut-ins.
JERRY: Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime.
LENA: Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup kitchen - they do have cream soups.
JERRY: Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person -
LENA: Oh, hang onto that thought - I'm rinsing a sweater, I left the water running. (Goes into the bathroom.) Hey, Jerry, can you get me a towel out of my bedroom closet?
JERRY: Oh, o.k. (Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.)
JERRY'S brain: Oh my god! Look what's goin' on here! She is depraved! (Grabs a towel and brings it to Lena.) There you are.
LENA: Thanks. So, you were saying...?
JERRY: What? Nothing.
LENA: No, you said I was a good person...
JERRY: Oh...
LENA: You seem like you want to tell me something.
JERRY: Tell you something...I do.
LENA: What is it, Jerry? You can tell me anything.
JERRY: Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing?
LENA: Yeah.
JERRY: I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. (Lena is puzzled.)
[George and Susan in bed. We see George's hands struggling to open a condom wrapper.]
SUSAN: Come on, George, just tear it open.
GEORGE: I'm trying, dammit.
SUSAN: Tear it.
GEORGE: I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips.
SUSAN: Here give it to me.
GEORGE: Would you wait a second? Just wait? (They fight over it.)
SUSAN: Give it to me. (She rips it open.) Come on. Come on!
GEORGE (tosses the condom aside): It's too late.
[Kramer surrounded by Cedric, Bob, and the other walkers.]
BOB: So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon?
KRAMER (nervously): No! Never.
BOB: But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!?
KRAMER: This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!
CEDRIC: What are we gonna do with him?
BOB: I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!
(Kramer tries to climb up a fire escape, but the mob grabs him and pulls him back down. Kramer screams.)
[Jerry and George waiting for Kramer at the finish line.]
JERRY: It completely turned her off.
GEORGE: Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?
JERRY: I don't wanna be a 32.
GEORGE: I'd kill to be a 32.
JERRY: She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
GEORGE: That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?
JERRY: It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
GEORGE: You never run out, do you? (Jerry smiles.) Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.
JERRY: Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?
(They see Kramer staggering towards them with cuts and bruises, clothes torn, one shoe off. He collapses and crawls across the finish line.)
JERRY: Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. (Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks at Kramer.)
GEORGE: Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon?
(Kramer looks at George unbelievingly.)
[Elaine and Billy in bed the next morning.]
ELAINE (smiling): Good morning.
BILLY: How'd you sleep?
ELAINE (stretches): Great. You?
BILLY: Fine, fine. Everything o.k.?
ELAINE: Yep.
BILLY: No regrets?
ELAINE: Nope. (Billy leans in to kiss her.) What are you doing?
BILLY: What do you mean?
ELAINE: Oh...I don't think so.
BILLY: Why not? I thought you said everything was fine.
ELAINE: I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. (Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.)
[Opening Monologue]
(unwrapping a piece of gum) I think gum is, is one of the weirdest human inventions. (pops gum in his mouth) It's not a liquid, 's not a solid, 's not a food. What is it? It isn't really anything, you know. I mean, it's like a stationary bike for your jaw. Like, remember when you were in school, and teachers would get all riled up if they caught you with gum? And when you were a kid, you'd think 'What is the big deal?' But, as an adult, I can understand it, because when you're chewing gum, you don't look like you're too thrilled with anything anyone has to say. (as sarcastic teen) 'Oh, World War Two. That was an important historical event? Yeah, I'm sure.' 'They landed a man on the moon, nineteen sixty-nine? Yeah, right. Yeah, I buy that, teach.'
[Monks']
(Jerry and George sitting in a booth, much as usual.)
GEORGE: You think she's happy?
JERRY: Who?
GEORGE: (indicates with his head) The cashier.
JERRY: Ruthie Cohen?
GEORGE: (surprised) You know her name?
JERRY: Sure.
GEORGE: I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
JERRY: Maybe that's why she's happy.
(Kramer enters. He has a handful of flyers.)
KRAMER: (handing Jerry & George a flyer) Good morning, gentlemen.
JERRY: What is this?
KRAMER: (removing his coat) Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre.
JERRY: That stinky old movie-house?
KRAMER: (sits beside Jerry) Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.
GEORGE: (gesturing with flyer) With Spartacus?
KRAMER: (lighting his pipe) Well, it's a rare archival print. (jumps as his burns his fingers) Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.
JERRY: Geoffrey who?
KRAMER: Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production.
GEORGE: Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?
KRAMER: Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? (looks around Monk's) Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.
GEORGE: Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?
KRAMER: Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status.
JERRY: I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.
KRAMER: Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.
GEORGE: Really?
KRAMER: Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.
JERRY: Oh, then I'm not worried.
(Lloyd Braun enters in the background.)
KRAMER: But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh.
(Lloyd wanders toward the guys at the table.)
GEORGE: (thoughtful) Breakdown, huh?
LLOYD: Hey Kramer.
KRAMER: Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. (gets up and shakes Lloyd's hand)
LLOYD: How you doing?
KRAMER: (slaps Lloyd on the shoulder) Sit down. (sits himself)
LLOYD: Hi Jerry.
JERRY: Lloyd.
LLOYD: George.
(Lloyd sits beside George.)
GEORGE: Hello, Lloyd. How you doing?
KRAMER: Yeah well, he's doing fine, George.
LLOYD: (offering packet) Gum?
JERRY: (peering) That's an interesting package.
LLOYD: Yeah, it's from China. Go ahead, try a piece. Tell me that's not the most delicious gum you've ever tasted.
KRAMER: Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. (he takes pieces for himself and Jerry)
LLOYD: George?
GEORGE: I don't chew gum.
JERRY: (chewing) Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?
LLOYD: Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it.
JERRY: Nah, don't bother.
LLOYD: No, it's no problem.
JERRY: I don't want it.
KRAMER: Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.
JERRY: Alright.
KRAMER: Mmm, delicious. This is delicious. Mmm.
[Jerry's Apartment]
(George sits at the table examining the contents of his wallet. Jerry is still chewing, and by his face, he's not enjoying it.)
GEORGE: You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.
(Elaine enters.)
ELAINE: Hey.
GEORGE: Hey.
JERRY: I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y. (he spits it into the waste bin)
ELAINE: What kind is that?
JERRY: It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me.
ELAINE: Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?
GEORGE: (almost gleeful) After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up.
ELAINE: You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?
JERRY: You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.
ELAINE: Yeah? Well, I got news for you.
GEORGE: The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'
JERRY: And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.
(George snaps his fingers and points to Jerry, signaling his agreement. Then he picks up his jacket and heads for the door.)
GEORGE: Right, gotta get going.
JERRY: Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?
GEORGE: Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.
JERRY: I thought your parents were outta town?
GEORGE: Why d'you think I'm going now?
[Street: Queens]
(George has parked his car on the street, and gets out. An elderly guy is on the porch of his house and recognises George.)
POP: Georgie!
GEORGE: Hey, Mr Lazzari.
POP: Back in the old neighborhood, ah?
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.
POP: Oh, snazzy car. Le Baron?
GEORGE: Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.
POP: The actor, right?
GEORGE: Something like that.
POP: Mind if I look under the hood?
GEORGE: Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars.
(A young woman has exited from the old guy's house, and approaches.)
POP: Oh, Deena! Deena, Deena, l... look who's here.
(Pop lifts the hood of the car, and leans into the engine compartment.)
DEENA: George Costanza, is that you?
GEORGE: Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. (they hug) Oh my gosh, you look as pretty as you did back in high school.
DEENA: Boy, those were some crazy times.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?
[Alex Theatre: Lobby]
(Kramer is leading Jerry and Elaine on a tour of the Alex. There are a few customers scattered about and a bored attendant behind the counter. Elaine has a big bucket of popcorn.)
KRAMER: The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time.
ELAINE: Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?
KRAMER: Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings.
JERRY: Oh, can Lloyd really do that?
KRAMER: Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. (to Elaine) And you should say hello to him, Elaine.
ELAINE: (concerned) What? Lloyd is here?
(Kramer indicates Lloyd approaching.)
ELAINE: What? No, no, I'd rather...
LLOYD: Hi Elaine.
ELAINE: (big fake smile) Lloyd, yes. Hello.
LLOYD: Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats, so we can all sit together.
ELAINE: (reluctant) Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, uhm, (desperately inventing) because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you afterwards.
(Elaine grabs Jerry by the arm and leads him toward the auditorium.)
LLOYD: That was odd. Am I crazy, or does Jerry not wear glasses?
KRAMER: (emphatic) You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all. (puts an arm round Lloyd's shoulder) Not crazy.
[Alex Theatre: Auditorium]
(Jerry and Elaine sit in the front row of seats. Elaine is eating popcorn.)
JERRY: We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?
ELAINE: I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.
(The lights go down, and music is heard as the show begins. Jerry and Elaine lean back in their seats to be able to see the screen.)
JERRY: Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable.
[Street: Queens]
(Deena and George are still talking. Pop is under the hood of George's car. Bangs and clanks can be heard as he fiddles with the mechanics.)
DEENA: Poor Lloyd.
GEORGE: I know. Completely bonkers!
DEENA: Sorry I can't be so flip about this kind of thing. You know, after what happened to Pop.
GEORGE: Pop? What happened to Pop?
DEENA: I thought you heard. He had a nervous breakdown last year. That's why I'm taking care of him.
(Pop comes out momentarily.)
POP: Oh, I tell you, they don't build 'em like this any more.
(He goes back under the hood.)
GEORGE: (a little worried) He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?
DEENA: Uhn, it was too much for him.
(Pop is thumping away at part of the engine with a spanner.)
GEORGE: (very worried) Uhm, I, I gotta go.
DEENA: What?
GEORGE: I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop.
[Alex Theatre: Auditorium]
(Kramer and Lloyd sits side by side in the special seats, watching Spartacus. They're smiling happily. Jerry and Elaine lean uncomfortably back in their front-row seats. They're both eating popcorn. Elaine drops a piece onto her blouse, where it rests next to a fancy button. She retrieves the corn, and dislodges the button without noticing. The button falls to the floor where it rests among other detritus.)
[George's Car]
(George is driving along the road in his Le Baron. Over the usual engine noise can be heard a metallic rasping, grinding noise. George listens for a few moments, wondering where it's coming from. Then he looks concerned, then angry.)
GEORGE: Pop! POP!!
[Alex Theatre: Lobby]
(Kramer and Jerry stand in the lobby. Kramer smoking his pipe, Jerry massaging his neck. Lloyd wanders over to join them.)
LLOYD: 's a great movie, huh?
KRAMER: Yeah.
LLOYD: Sorry you forgot those glasses.
JERRY: I don't know what I was thinking.
LLOYD: How'd you like that gum?
JERRY: (noncommittal) Errh.
KRAMER: (slapping Jerry on the back) Ah, he loved it.
(Elaine enters. In the absence of the button she lost in the auditorium, her blouse is open to below her breasts, and everything's in the shop window. Not that she knows it.)
ELAINE: Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired.
(Elaine is suffering with her neck. She rolls her head back and feels the back of her neck with her hand.)
ELAINE: Oh. Oh God.
LLOYD: You alright?
(Elaine stretches her back and neck, at the same time pushing her upperworks into greater prominence.)
ELAINE: Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.
(Elaine leaves. Kramer and Lloyd both stare after her.)
[Street Outside Alex]
(Elaine walks down the sidewalk, her blouse still open. A florist is using a hose to wash down the sidewalk in front of his store. Elaine carefully steps by, picking her way past. The florist also stares at Elaine's exposure. A cop stands a little further down the street. Elaine approaches him.)
ELAINE: Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?
(The cop stares at Elaine's breasts the whole time she's talking.)
COP: Lady, you sold me. (strides toward florist) Hey, you with the hose.
(Elaine looks confused about his attitude. She glances down, and notices her blouse wide open. She quickly pulls her coat closed, to hide her embarrassment, and hurries away.)
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Kramer is handing Jerry a pair of spectacles.)
KRAMER: Yeah, put these glasses on.
JERRY: (taking them) Well, what's this for?
KRAMER: Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.
JERRY: So what?
KRAMER: Well, he thinks you wear those.
(Jerry looks at the glasses with some distaste.)
KRAMER: They're from the lost and found at the Alex.
JERRY: Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.
KRAMER: Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.
[Monk's]
(George leans on the counter by the cash register, behind which sits Ruthie Cohen.)
GEORGE: 'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill, (smiles) but you only gave me change for a ten.
CASHIER: I don't think so.
GEORGE: Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, (smiles) that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?
CASHIER: Not unless you buy something.
GEORGE: Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum.
(Lloyd approaches the register to pay for something. The cashier rings up George's purchase.)
LLOYD: Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?
GEORGE: I don't.
(Ruthie opens the drawer on the register.)
CASHIER: Take a look.
(George goes round to the other side of the register and picks up all the twenty-dollar bills. He shuffles through them, examining them for doodles.)
GEORGE: I know I gave it to you.
LLOYD: George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry.
(In addition to Lloyd, another customer is waiting to pay.)
GEORGE: (frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for the door) Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily!
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry is reading a newspaper, and holding it in such a way as to conceal his face.)
KRAMER: Hey, Jerry, look who's here.
(Jerry folds over the top half of the paper, in order to see his visitor. He also reveals to all that he is wearing the spectacles Kramer gave him earlier.)
JERRY: Ah, Lloyd.
LLOYD: Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum.
(He proffers the packet to Jerry.)
JERRY: (unenthusiastic) Oh, the gum.
KRAMER: Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?
JERRY: (still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)
KRAMER: Oh, boy.
(Kramer and Lloyd sit on the couch. All of them start chewing on the gum.)
KRAMER: Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this.
(Jerry makes a show of removing his glasses and cleaning them.)
JERRY: Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.
(Jerry puts his glasses back on.)
LLOYD: Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you to him, you can get it whenever you want.
JERRY: 's not necessary.
KRAMER: Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.
JERRY: I know that, Kramer.
LLOYD: Well, if you don't want to...
KRAMER: No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?
JERRY: Yes I do, Kramer.
LLOYD: So...
KRAMER: Yeah?
LLOYD: How about that Elaine today, huh?
KRAMER: Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?
LLOYD: (to Jerry) She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.
JERRY: I didn't see anything.
KRAMER: Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom, ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba.
(They continue to chew on the gum. Lloyd seemingly happily, Jerry clearly not liking it, and Kramer not liking it, but unwilling to show it to Lloyd.)
[Park]
(George and Deena sit on a bench.)
DEENA: You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you again.
(George clearly thinks he's clicked.)
GEORGE: Well, you know. (grins, snorts) It's understandable.
(He pats Deena on the knee.)
DEENA: I'm glad you feel that way. Because since my father's breakdown I uh, become very sensitive to the warning signs.
GEORGE: Warning signs?
DEENA: Nervousness, irritability, paranoia.
GEORGE: (disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem. (defensive) Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.
DEENA: Yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others.
GEORGE: All my friends do that.
DEENA: George, I'm only trying to help...
(George is staring past Deena at something a short distance away.)
DEENA: I'm... I'm concerned. George? George, are you listening to me?
GEORGE: You see that woman on the horse? (points)
(Ruthie Cohen is passing by on horseback.)
GEORGE: She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!
DEENA: So again it all comes back to Lloyd.
GEORGE: (rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come back here!! Don't gallop away!!
(George runs away, yelling after the retreating Ruthie Cohen.)
[Monk's]
(Jerry and George sit in a booth. There's a different cashier on duty.)
JERRY: So you say she was on a horse?
GEORGE: I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.
JERRY: Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips.
(Elaine enters.)
ELAINE: Hey.
JERRY: Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue.
ELAINE: (sits beside Jerry) What?
JERRY: I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.
ELAINE: (laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre.
JERRY: Maybe it's in the lost and found.
ELAINE: Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's.
JERRY: You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.
[Alex Theatre: Lobby]
(Kramer greets a small elderly gent.)
KRAMER: Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre.
HAARWOOD: Well I, I'm in a bit of a quandary. I've misplaced my spectacles.
KRAMER: Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?
(Kramer ducks behind the counter to retrieve the lost and found box.)
HAARWOOD: They're half-glasses.
(Kramer pops his head up, a thought having occurred.)
KRAMER: Brown?
HAARWOOD: Mmm, yes, yes.
(Kramer places the cardboard box marked 'Lost and Found' on the counter.)
KRAMER: Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.
HAARWOOD: Certainly.
(Kramer leaves. Haarwood begins to rummage through the contents of the box. After a few seconds, he finds something. He lifts it out for a closer look. It's the button Elaine dropped earlier.)
HAARWOOD: Oh my goodness. What a spanking button.
[George's Car: Street Outside Alex]
(George starts his car. It's still making unhealthy noises. As he sits with the engine running, a car pulls up in the street behind him. The driver sounds the horn at George as he sits in his parking spot.)
GEORGE: (glances in mirror) Alright. Alright.
(The horn sounds again.)
GEORGE: (getting annoyed) Hang on, it's warming up!
(The horn sounds several more times, impatiently. George has had enough. He climbs out of his car.)
GEORGE: (angrily) Oh you mother...
(George stalks round his car and up to the driver's window of the car sounding its horn.)
GEORGE: Hey! What is your problem?
(The driver rolls down the window, and we see Ruthie Cohen.)
GEORGE: Oh, hello, it's you! (angry) Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. (smug) Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?
CASHIER: Your car's on fire.
(The reflection of leaping flames can be seen in Ruthie's window. George dashes off back to his car.)
GEORGE: Aah! Fire!
CASHIER: (after George) Merry Christmas!
(Flames are coming from under the hood of the Le Baron.)
GEORGE: (shouting) Fire!!
(The florist is standing holding a broom. George rushes to him.)
GEORGE: Your hose! Where's your hose?!
FLORIST: Cop made me disconnect it.
(George grabs the broom from the florist, and begins beating at the flames with no effect. After a few seconds, the broom is alight.)
[Street Outside Alex]
(The whole front of George's car is burnt out. The plastic body parts have melted away. The hood is wide open, showing the devastation within. George stands, holding the charred remnants of the broom. He's staring catatonically at the damage. Kramer walks up and does a double-take at the sight.)
KRAMER: Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy?
GEORGE: The Jon Voight car is no more.
KRAMER: Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.
GEORGE: No kidding?
KRAMER: No kidding.
GEORGE: Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.
KRAMER: Yeah, merry Christmas.
(Kramer walks on.)
GEORGE: (staring at the wreck) Whatever.
[Alex Theatre: Lobby]
(Jerry is waiting. He's wearing the glasses from earlier.)
JERRY: Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?
KRAMER: What, he's not here yet?
JERRY: Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!
KRAMER: Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses.
(Kramer reaches across and plucks the glasses from Jerry's face.)
JERRY: Why?
KRAMER: They're Geoffrey Haarwood's.
(Kramer rummages in lost and found, and brings out another pair of spectacles.)
KRAMER: (proffering) Here, try this pair.
(Jerry puts them on. The lenses are much stronger than the first pair - they're like bottle-bottoms. He stares through them, his eyes magnified hugely. It's obvious he can't see at all clearly.)
JERRY: Aw, these are really strong glasses.
(He takes a step and almost trips over the counter.)
LLOYD: Hey gum-buddy. Nice frames. You ready to go?
JERRY: (lacking enthusiasm) Yeah, yeah.
KRAMER: (clapping Jerry on the back) Oh yeah, he's all ready to go.
LLOYD: Anybody see Elaine today?
KRAMER: Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out lost and found.
LLOYD: Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not wearing, if you know what I mean.
(They chuckle.)
JERRY: Absolutely. Let's just stick around.
LLOYD: Ah, tell you what, they're expecting us though. Lemme just grab a hotdog here.
KRAMER: Uh, yeah.
(Lloyd goes to the counter, and speaks to the attendant.)
LLOYD: I'd like a hotdog, please.
(The attendant looks to the machine, which contains one hotdog. The appearance of the article is not pleasant. It's wrinkled, shriveled, and generally disgusting.)
ATTENDANT: Are you outta your mind?
(Hearing this, Kramer dashes over.)
KRAMER: Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?
ATTENDANT: This hotdog's been here since the silent era. You'd have to be insane to eat it.
KRAMER: No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong with it or you.
LLOYD: Kramer, maybe...
KRAMER: No, no, no, no. I'll show you. (slams a bill down on the counter) One hotdog please.
ATTENDANT: (on your head be it) Okay.
KRAMER: Mmm, doesn't that smell good, huh?
(The attendant hands over the hotdog.)
KRAMER: Yeah, here we go, yeah. (he takes a big bite) Mmm, oh. That's delicious. Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. (he takes another bite)
(As he chews, it begins to be apparent that all is not as it should be with the hotdog.)
KRAMER: Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy. (he half-coughs, half-retches) I gotta get, some air.
(Kramer stumbles toward the exit, bits of half-chewed hotdog falling from his mouth.)
[Street Outside Alex]
(Kramer walks stiffly along the sidewalk. He's breathing heavily, and loosening his collar. He walks by the florist, who is brushing the sidewalk again. As Kramer passes George's car, his struggle with the rancid hotdog ends with the hotdog triumphant, and he leans into the gutter behind the Le Baron and vomits copiously. The florist looks rueful, leans his broom against his door, and fetches his hose, whilst Kramer continues his refunding.)
[Street Outside Alex: Later]
(The florist is hosing away the traces of Kramer's visit. Elaine walks up to him.)
ELAINE: Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?
FLORIST: How would you happen to know that?
ELAINE: Well, uhm... I...
FLORIST: (accusing) You're that lady that was talking to the cops, aren't you?
ELAINE: Uh... I...
(A voice calls from across the street.)
VOICE (O.C.): Hey, Joe!
(The florist turns to see who's shouting. As he does, he raises the nozzle of his hose, so instead of hosing the sidewalk, he sprays Elaine.)
ELAINE: No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!
(The florist notices what he's done and turns off the hose.)
[Alex Theatre: Lobby]
(Jerry sits beside Kramer, who still looks unwell. Lloyd stands comforting Kramer. Elaine enters. She has removed her jacket, and is wearing a wringing wet t-shirt.)
ELAINE: Hey. Hey everybody.
LLOYD: Whoah, Elaine! Once again, you've managed to top yourself. C'mon Jerry, let's go. Car's out front.
(Lloyd leaves. Jerry stands and peers about himself through the over-strength glasses. All he can make out are vague blurred shapes.)
JERRY: Lloyd?
(He moves across the lobby, slowly, holding his hands out to feel for obstacles.)
JERRY: Lloyd?
(Jerry leaves.)
ELAINE: (exasperated) What is Lloyd's problem?
KRAMER: Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt.
ELAINE: Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your swing joints.
(Elaine casts her eyes heavenward.)
[Street Outside Alex]
(The remains of George's car are being towed away. On the opposite side of the road, watching, are Deena and George.)
DEENA: So, you want my father to pay for this?
GEORGE: You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there.
DEENA: And I suppose Lloyd Braun had something to do with it too.
GEORGE: No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier.
DEENA: What cashier?
GEORGE: You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.
DEENA: To park her horse?
GEORGE: No, she wasn't on the horse.
DEENA: So, your car caught fire because of my father and the woman on the horse?
GEORGE: That's right.
(Across the street, the florist is outside his store, arranging flowers.)
GEORGE: (points) And him!
DEENA: The man with the flowers?
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but...
(A car pulls up beside George and Deena. George looks in the window.)
GEORGE: I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.
DEENA: Who?
GEORGE: Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls to Jerry) Jerry.
(Jerry hears his name called and turns his head, but all he can see are blurry colored shapes.)
GEORGE: Jerry! Over here Jerry. It's me!
(The car pulls away, leaving George calling after it.)
GEORGE: Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're...
DEENA: (doubtful) That was your best friend?
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses.
DEENA: That man was wearing glasses.
GEORGE: I know. Don't you see. (emphatic) He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!
[Lloyd Braun's Car]
(Jerry and Lloyd have reached Chinatown. Lloyd parks the car.)
LLOYD: I'll run in and get the gum.
JERRY: Alright.
LLOYD: Got any money?
(Jerry digs his wallet out of his pocket. He opens it and extracts a bill. He peers at it, trying to work out what denomination it is, but the glasses are still too strong.)
JERRY: (handing it over) Here.
(Lloyd takes the bill, looks at it, smiles a little with surprise.)
LLOYD: (climbing out of the car) I'll be back.
[Street]
(George and Deena walk along together.)
GEORGE: Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a series of bad coincidences.
DEENA: I don't know, George. I don't know what to believe.
GEORGE: Believe me, I am not crazy.
DEENA: Well, I guess it's possible.
[Lloyd Braun's Car]
(Jerry sits waiting. Lloyd gets in. He has a stack of six boxes, which he hands to Jerry.)
LLOYD: Here y'go.
JERRY: (indistinct) Got all this?
LLOYD: Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth.
JERRY: (incredulous) I gave you a hundred dollars?!
LLOYD: You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?
JERRY: It's a lotta gum!
[The Institute]
(The room is festooned with props and costumes from old movies.)
KRAMER: Mr Hararwood. Found your glasses.
HAARWOOD: Oh, splendid. Welcome to the Institute for the Preservation of Motion Picture Costumes and Wardrobe.
KRAMER: Ah, the I.P.M.P.C.W.
HAARWOOD: Well eh, we prefer to call it the Institute.
(Kramer notices a particular costume.)
KRAMER: Is that from Henry the Eighth?
HAARWOOD: Yes, yes, it is.
KRAMER: Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?
HAARWOOD: Well, I... I'd love to lend it to you, but I doubt if it would fit a man of your impressive, Raymond Massey-like, physique. The only person who could really fit into this costume, would have to be a short, stocky, man of somewhat generous proportions.
KRAMER: (an idea occurs) You don't say.
[Street]
(Kramer and George walk together. George is wearing the Henry VIII costume - doublet and hose, cloak, crown, etc.)
KRAMER: You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.
KRAMER: Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.
GEORGE: (angry undertone) Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here.
(He gets his wallet from under the cape, and goes to the window of a kiosk.)
GEORGE: (handing over a bill) Can I get a pack of gum, please?
GUY: I beg your pardon, your majesty, but we don't accept bills with lipstick on the president.
GEORGE: What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? (snorts) I guess I owe that cashier an apology.
(Deena is walking toward George and Kramer. She sees George in his costume and jumps to the obvious conclusion.)
DEENA: Oh my God!
GEORGE: No, no. Deena, it's not what you think.
(Deena turns and begins to walk away.)
GEORGE: Th... this isn't mine.
(George begins to walk after Deena, who accelerates to a trot.)
GEORGE: I got it from the Institute. The Institute.
(Deena breaks into a run, with George chasing her.)
GEORGE: (shouting) Dee... Deena!
[Alex Theatre: Lobby]
(Kramer stands behind the counter, upon which Elaine leans. Mr Haarwood enters.)
KRAMER: Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere.
HAARWOOD: Well, thank you. Uh, where is your friend King Henry?
KRAMER: Oh, he ran away.
(Lloyd enters.)
LLOYD: Hey Kramer.
KRAMER: I need to talk to you.
Lloyd and Kramer go away to the side of the lobby, where they go into a quiet conversation. Elaine is peering over at Mr Haarwood, and in particular at the button he's wearing on his cravat.
ELAINE: You know, that button looks very familiar.
HAARWOOD: Yes, it, it, it's antique ivory.
ELAINE: I, I think that's my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?
HAARWOOD: Yes, it was in the lost and found.
ELAINE: Shall I undo it?
HAARWOOD: Oh yes, of course you can.
ELAINE: Oh, thank you.
(Elaine moves very close to Mr Haarwood, and reaches under his chin to remove the button.)
HAARWOOD: I'm a little ticklish.
ELAINE: Oh. (giggly) Tickle, tickle.
(Kramer and Lloyd are both staring over at the sight of Elaine tickling Mr Haarwood under the chin, giggling, apparently flirting.)
LLOYD: We've really gotta get that Elaine a boyfriend.
KRAMER: Oh, tell me about it.
ELAINE: (thinking) I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again.
(club applauds)
ELAINE: Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.
JERRY: Maybe he'll write a song about you.
ELAINE: Yeah. Right. (laughing) Like that really matters.
JERRY: So I take it he's spongeworthy?
ELAINE: Oh, yeah.
JERRY: Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.
ELAINE: Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.
JERRY: Oh, no?
ELAINE: Yeah. In fact, he....(moaning)
JERRY: Come on. Come on.
ELAINE: I don't wanna!
JERRY: Elaine, you're among friends.
ELAINE: (sighs) Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.
JERRY: Oh.
ELAINE: Yeah. It's surprising.
JERRY: Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?
ELAINE: No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.
JERRY: Sure. Why not? You're there.
ELAINE: Exactly.
JERRY: But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.
KRAMER: Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my stuff outta the car.
JERRY: What stuff?
KRAMER: I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.
JERRY: All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff.
KRAMER: Course I will. These are staples.
JERRY: A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?
KRAMER: Lindsay olives, Jerry.
JERRY: A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?
KRAMER: $17.50. You can't beat that.
JERRY: Look...look at this can of tuna!
KRAMER: Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut.
JERRY: This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.
KRAMER: Hey, Clyde!
CLYDE: Hey, Kramer! What's happening, dude?
KRAMER: Yeah. Ahh. Hey, this is Jerry here.
CLYDE: How ya doin'?
JERRY: Hi.
KRAMER: You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.
JERRY: John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.
CLYDE: Oh yeah?
JERRY: Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy.
CLYDE: Is that right?
KRAMER: Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs.
CLYDE: Oh, sorry Kramer, I got to watch the hands. My hands are my life.
ESTELLE: Georgie, can you zip me up?
GEORGE: Yeah. Yeah, one second.
ESTELLE: Well, come on!
GEORGE: All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night.
ESTELLE: Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.
GEORGE: My in-laws. Oh, my....
FRANK: So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to, huh?
ESTELLE: I don't like that tie.
FRANK: What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it.
ESTELLE: It's too thin. They're wearing wide now.
FRANK: How do you know what kind of ties they wear?
ESTELLE: Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead!
FRANK: Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue.
ESTELLE: George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?
FRANK: Huh?
GEORGE: I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.
FRANK: We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's.
ESTELLE: It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here.
FRANK: No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people something about taste!
GEORGE: This is gonna be fun.
JERRY: Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in your friend John Germaine's band there.
ELAINE: So what did he have to say?
JERRY: Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.
ELAINE: Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?
JERRY: Yeah.
ELAINE: What did you do that for?
JERRY: What?
ELAINE: What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.
JERRY: Oh
ELAINE: I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.
JERRY: Well, Clyde might not tell him.
ELAINE: How do you know that?
JERRY: I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
ELAINE: Ohh!
(Kramer, walking down hall to his apartment, his arms loaded with dozens of pop cans, falls forward, spilling cans about in hallway)
DENNIS: Let me give you a hand. Hey, Kramer. I wonder, could you do me a favor? I'm taking the family to Disneyworld next week. I wonder...
KRAMER: Uh-huh.
DENNIS: I wonder, could you pick up my mail?
KRAMER: Yeah. Sure. Sure.
DENNIS: In fact, you know what, how would you like to take my hansom cab for the week?
KRAMER: Drive the horse?
DENNIS: It'll just be sitting there. You can really clean up. 500 bucks a day. I'll split it with ya.
KRAMER: Oh, giddyup. Yeah.
GEORGE: This is delicious, Mrs. Ross.
MRS. ROSS: Oh.
MR. ROSS: What are you complimenting her for? She didn't make it Rowenna did.
FRANK: What is this thing anyway?
MRS. ROSS: It's Cornish gamehen.
FRANK: What is that, like a little chicken?
GEORGE: It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. (laughing) Little chicken. It's a gamebird.
FRANK: Gamebird?
GEORGE: Yeah.
FRANK: What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it?
MR. ROSS: Yes.
FRANK: How hard could it be to kill this thing?
ESTELLE: I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.
MRS. ROSS: If I had a dime for every book he's actually read, (laughing) I'd be broke.
SUSAN: More wine anyone?
FRANK: Yeah. I'll take some.
SUSAN: Hmmm?
FRANK: Thank you.
SUSAN: How do you like the Merlot?
ESTELLE: Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?
MRS. ROSS: Oh, mother.
GEORGE: She's, uh, she's heard of Merlot.
FRANK: Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?
GEORGE: Why don't we talk about it another time.
FRANK: But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a chicken. Something's missing!
MRS. ROSS: Something's missing all right.
MR. ROSS: They're all chickens. The rooster has sex with all of them.
FRANK: That's perverse.
GEORGE: Did anybody see Firestorm?
MR. ROSS: Firestorm, that's a hell of a picture.
GEORGE: Yeah.
MR. ROSS: Remember when they had the helicopter land on top of that car --
FRANK: Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I haven't seen it yet.
MR. ROSS: It doesn't have anything to do with the plot!
FRANK: Still! Still! I like to go in fresh!
GEORGE: Oh mother of God.
(clip clop)
KRAMER: Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty!
(applause)
JOHN: Thank you. Now, I'd like to play something th -- well, actually, it's my latest so it's nice and fresh. It's called " Hot And Heavy."
(saxophone playing)
GEORGE: Thank God that's over.
ESTELLE: The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.
FRANK: And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it kill them to put out a pound cake? Something!
GEORGE: So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal.
ESTELLE: It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.
FRANK: Not impolite...it's stupid, that's what it is. You gotta be stupid to do something like that!
ESTELLE: Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots drinking coffee without a piece of cake!
GEORGE: What is this? The marble rye?
MRS. ROSS: Oh, dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they brought.
ESTELLE: We forgot to bring it in.
FRANK: No, I brought it in. They never put it out.
MRS. ROSS: Where is it?
SUSAN: I don't know. Where'd you put it?
MRS. ROSS: Right over there.
SUSAN: Well, it's gone.
GEORGE: You stole the bread?
FRANK: What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should I leave it there?
GEORGE: Because we brought it for them!
FRANK: Apparently, it wasn't good enough for them to serve.
MRS. ROSS: Is it possible they took it back?
SUSAN: Who would bring a bread and take it back?
MR. ROSS: Those people, that's who. I think they're sick.
ESTELLE: People take buses to get that rye.
GEORGE: Maybe they forgot to put it out!
FRANK: Aw, they didn't forget to put it out! It's deliberate! Deliberate, I tell ya!
JERRY: He stole back the rye?
GEORGE: Yeah.
JERRY: Why?
GEORGE: Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.
JERRY: So, do the Ross's know?
GEORGE: I don't know. They're all very suspicious.
JERRY: Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.
GEORGE: Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life.
JERRY: Bad situation.
GEORGE: I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.
JERRY: What do you mean replace it?
GEORGE: You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is.
JERRY: Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?
GEORGE: What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I can't just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the apartment!
JERRY: All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom cab.
GEORGE: So?
JERRY: Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.
GEORGE: And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that?
JERRY: Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop, clip clop. They're nuts for it.
GEORGE: So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is there.
JERRY: What about Susan?
GEORGE: She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven o'clock.
JERRY: Beautiful!
GEORGE: You think Kramer'll do it?
KRAMER: Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there at seven?
GEORGE: Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour.
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: What the hell are you doing there?
KRAMER: It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?
JERRY: No. No thanks.
KRAMER: Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all.
GEORGE: Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread into the apartment?
JERRY: Just put it under your shirt.
GEORGE: Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!
JERRY: I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave.
GEORGE: Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! (laughing)
ELAINE: Hey. Is that your horse outside?
KRAMER: Yeah. That's Rusty.
GEORGE: What? He's outside?
KRAMER: Uh-huh.
GEORGE: Aw, come on. I wanna go see him.
KRAMER: You wanna go see him?
GEORGE: Yeah. Hey! Hey!
KRAMER: I'll show ya Rusty.
GEORGE: Hey, Lainey, wanna see the horsey?
ELAINE: Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then you have to come along with your hot and your heavy.
JERRY: So, you think Clyde told him?
ELAINE: He wrote a song about it!
JERRY: Well, maybe it's a good thing.
ELAINE: No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?
JERRY: No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.
ELAINE: You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to!
JERRY: No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.
ELAINE: I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset him.
MR. ROSS: Yeah George, I gotta tell ya, this is a very nice gesture. We really appreciate it.
GEORGE: Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs?
MR. ROSS: Oh, we got about twenty minutes. You, uh, seem a little nervous George. Anything wrong?
GEORGE: Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine. Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh, could I get a glass of water?
MRS. ROSS: We've got water. I don't think we have any bread, but we've got water.
KRAMER: Yeah. There ya go. That's Beef-A-Reeno. (singing) I'm so keen-o On Beef-A-Reeno What a delicious cuisine-o Fit for a king and queen-o! Yeah. Eat up. I got thirty four more cans.
MR. ROSS: Nice night for a hansom cab ride, 'ay George?
MRS. ROSS: You know, George we haven't done anything romantic like this in ....years.
GEORGE: (thinking) Oh my God, it's 7:01. What have I done? My whole plan is depending on Kramer? Have I learned nothing? How could I make such a stupid mistake? He'll never show up!
(clip clop)
KRAMER: Ah ha!
GEORGE: There he is. Right on time as usual.
COUNTER WOMAN: 53.
MABEL: 53. I'd like a marble rye, no plastic, in a bag.
COUNTER WOMAN: Ah! You're lucky. It's our last one.
JERRY: Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?
COUNTER WOMAN: That's right.
JERRY: There's none left?
COUNTER WOMAN: That's what I said. Number 54.
JERRY: Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may depend on it.
MABEL: Well, I'm sorry, but you should have got here earlier.
JERRY: Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to give it up.
MABEL: You're not getting this rye --
JERRY: All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you double what you paid for it.
MABEL: You're in my way!
KRAMER: Ahh! Mr. Ross. Mrs. Ross. My name is Cosmo and I'll be your driver for this evening. We have blankets for your comfort. I also have hot chocolate if the mood should strike you.
MRS. ROSS: My favorite.
KRAMER: Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh, happy anniversary. On, Rusty!
(clip clop)
JERRY: All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now, be reasonable you cannot turn down $50 for a $6 rye.
MABEL: No? Watch me.
JERRY: Give me that rye!
MABEL: Stop it!
JERRY: I want that rye, lady!
MABEL: Help! Someone help!
JERRY: Shut up, you old bag!
MABEL: Stop thief! Stop him! He's got my marble rye!
ELAINE: I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?
JOHN: Whoa. Hold on, Elaine I.....I'm kinda disappointed.
ELAINE: Disappointed?
JOHN: Yeah. I mean, I was excited when Clyde told me that.
ELAINE: You were?
JOHN: Absolutely.
ELAINE: Ohh! Whew! I am so relieved!
JOHN: Listen, uh, I've still got a couple of hours to kill before the next show. My place is only a few blocks from here.
ELAINE: Really?
JOHN: And you know what?
ELAINE: What?
JOHN: I've been thinking about what we do and I'm thinking..of...adding a new number to my, you know, repertoire.
ELAINE: Ohh!
(clip clop)
(Rusty snorting)
KRAMER: Y'aah!
(clip clop)
(Rusty farts)
MRS. ROSS: (sniffing) What is that?
MR. ROSS: I think it's the horse.
MRS. ROSS: Oh, God.
KRAMER: Hey, how's everything? You..you need anything?
MRS. ROSS: This is - this is...horrible.
MR. ROSS: Excuse me,...what do you feed this animal?
KRAMER: Oh, you know, oats and hay. You know, they like that stuff.
MRS. ROSS: I can't take this. Let me out of this thing!
MR. ROSS: Turn this thing around. We've had it. We can't breathe back here! And hurry it up!
KRAMER: Rusty! Rusty!
GEORGE: (whistling)
(clip clopping beginning in distance and growing discernibly louder)
KRAMER: Whoa!
GEORGE: Wha - what happened? What are you doing back so soon?
MR. ROSS: Ask Rusty.
KRAMER: I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross. One never knows how the gastrointestinal workings of the equine are going to function.
MRS. ROSS: Thanks for nothing! Come on, George. Let's go upstairs.
GEORGE: What the hell happened?
KRAMER: The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.
GEORGE: Beef-A-Reeno? You fed the horse Beef-A-Reeno?!
KRAMER: Well, I overbought!
MR. ROSS: George.
GEORGE: (muttering)
MUSIC GUY: What's going on? Where is he?
MANAGER: Uh...he'll be here soon.
MUSIC GUY: I'll give him ten more minutes. I'm not gonna stay here all night.
JERRY: How much did you give him?
KRAMER: Just a can. But he really liked it, though.
GEORGE: Jerry! Up here!
JERRY: Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?
GEORGE: I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up!
JERRY: Really?
GEORGE: Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding me?
JERRY: Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't get any oxygen.
KRAMER: I don't wanna go back on there!
GEORGE: Come on!
JERRY: (grunting as he throws bread into the air)
GEORGE: (grunting) Hey! Hey, wait a second. I got an idea.
ELAINE: No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have to try so hard. Good luck, honey.
GEORGE: Come on! Come on!
JERRY: Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before. Your hook is too small. This is for, like, a muffin. All right. Take it away.
(George finally gets rye into apartment, turning around to discover everyone staring at him)
GEORGE: Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. (grunting)
MANAGER: Ladies and gentlemen, John Germaine.
(applause)
(John attempts to play saxophone, discovering that no sound is being created by the instrument)
[Opening monologue]
I don't know why people are surprised, when someone gets hit in the head, with a golf ball. Do you ever watch these tournaments on TV? You got 600 people crowding around a hole that big (hands in the shape of a golf hole) and no one can believe it when a Titleist gets bounced off of someone's coconut. You know you throw a rock into a crowd, that's considered terrorism... but if you have a nice follow through (makes a pretend golf swing) you know - that's golf (pointing finger in the air). I'm always impressed actually with the golf cameraman, who's job it is, to, follow the golf ball when it's in the sky. You know what I mean, it's a little white ball, it's doing a hundred miles an hour on a white background -- I got it, I lost it, I got it, I lost it, I got it, I lost it, (spinning back and forth) -- Why bother... aim the camera at the sky, aim it at the ground, take a ball out of you pocket, throw it down -- who's gonna know where the hell it came from.
[Jerry's Apartment]
JERRY: How did you lock your keys in the car?
GEORGE: How? Cause I'm an Idiot.
JERRY: So why don't you get a locksmith?
GEORGE: I was going to, but then I found out that the auto club has this free locksmith service, so I signed up.  Just waiting for the membership to kick in.
JERRY: How long has your car been sitting in the Yankee parking lot?
GEORGE: I don't know, about three days.
(Kramer enters with golf clubs)
KRAMER: Hello boys.
JERRY: Y- you're not playin' golf?
KRAMER: Yes, indeed.  The calendar says winter, but he gods of spring are out.
GEORGE: Are the courses open?
KRAMER: No, no........I'm sneaking in with Stan the Caddy, we've been going through the caddies entrance.
GEORGE: Huh, No kidding?
KRAMER: Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else. Stan's advice has transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually I'll have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. (sucks in air through tight lips) Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.
JERRY: Really, you're getting that good?
KRAMER: Oh, I'm the real deal.
(Knocking is heard from outside in the hallway)
KRAMER: Yeah, here, Stan, in here!
(Stan enters)
KRAMER: There he is, yeah - Jerry, George, *this* is Stan the Caddy.
GEORGE: How ya doin'?
JERRY: Hi.
STAN: Nice to meet you.  Ready to hit the links, Kramer?
KRAMER: Oh yeah, you betcha.
STAN: What are those, ah, cotton pants?
KRAMER: Yeah, Yeah...Why, is it too cold out?
STAN: Here's what you do: you bring a lightweight jacket, that way the sun comes out, you play the jacket off the sweater.
KRAMER: Ah, that makes sense, that's a good call, Stan.  Alright, we'll see you guys later, huh?
GEORGE: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, we'll see ya.
(Kramer and Stan leave)
GEORGE & JERRY: (together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards)  Stan The Caddy.
[On the street]
SUE ELLEN: Elaine?
(Elaine turns to see Sue Ellen waving her hand)
SUE ELLEN: Hi!
ELAINE (thinking to herself):  Oh, great.  It's the bra-less wonder. Who does she think she's kidding?  Look at her, she's totally out of control.
SUE ELLEN: I was thinking that woman looks like Elaine Benes.
ELAINE: Yeah, ha ha ha.  What have you been up to?
SUE ELLEN: I've just been hanging out.
ELAINE (nodding): I see.
SUE ELLEN: Hmm. Oh, listen!  I'm having a birthday party tomorrow evening, I'd love it if you came by.
ELAINE: Oh Tomorrow...?
SUE ELLEN: Um-hm.
ELAINE: I don't know if I can.
SUE ELLEN: Nooo?
ELAINE: Yeah, I'm just really, really busy.
SUE ELLEN: Oh, that's too bad.
ELAINE: Yeah, yeah.
SUE ELLEN: Well, I hope you can get me a gift anyway.........ha ha ha.
ELAINE: Ah Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[Yankee Stadium]
WILHELM: George!?
GEORGE: (he drops a paper airplane he was holding) Mr. Wilhelm!
WILHELM: I'm sorry to interrupt you, but Mr. Steinbrenner and I really want you to know we appreciate all the hours you've been putting in… Oh, and, ah, confidentially, Sozonkel, our Assistant to the General Manger, hasn't really been working out. And the boss thinks you're the man for the job!  So, keep it under your hat!
[Exterior at dusk of Jerry's Apartment, then inside Jerry's apartment]
GEORGE: Assistant to the General Manager!!  Do you know what means?!?  He'd could be askin' my advice on trades!  Trades, Jerry, I'm a heartbeat away!
JERRY: That's a hell of an organization they're running up there.  I can't understand why they haven't won a pennant in 15 years.
GEORGE: And, it is all because of that car…
(shot of Steinbrenner's car pulling into his parking space and getting out of the car, with the Costanza sign in the background )
GEORGE: …See, Steinbrenner is like the first guy in, at the crack of dawn.  He sees my car, he figures I'm the first guy in…
(night shot of Wilhelm walking out to the parking lot, he sees George's car and nods approvingly)
GEORGE: …Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm.  He sees my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil.  Between the two of them, they think I'm working an 18 hour day! (he stands there with his hands on his hips, a wide grin - laughing.)
JERRY: Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made.
(Elaine enters)
ELAINE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
GEORGE: Hey, how ya doing?!?
ELAINE: Better, now.
JERRY: Yeah, what happened?
ELAINE: You know Sue Ellen Mishke?
JERRY: Sue Ellen Mishke?
ELAINE: Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last year...
JERRY: Sounds familiar.
ELAINE: The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune--
JERRY: Oh, yeah, you mentioned her.
ELAINE: Yes. Yes  I ran into her today.  This woman has never, not once, ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra.
GEORGE: Ah, that is disgusting--
JERRY: That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no--
GEORGE: She's a pig. The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--
JERRY: It's wrong, it's rude, and it's incorrect.
GEORGE: It's disgusting--
ELAINE (getting up to leave):  Alright, there's no---
GEORGE: Come on! Come-on.
JERRY: We're only kidding!
ELAINE: You don't understand.  See, she hasn't changed at all.  She stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. (flashback sequence) I was at this party, and I was dating this *really* cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way, and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows her, right out the door!
JERRY (excited): She's your Lex Luthor!
ELAINE: Her birthday's comin' up, see, so I decided to get her a little present.
JERRY: What are you going to get her?
ELAINE: A very traditional, a very supportive, brazier.
JERRY: There's nothing subtle about that.
GEORGE: No, no, she might just think it's a gift.
JERRY: Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?
[Monk's]
GEORGE: Ahh, Hey-Ho. ahhhhh (exhales)
JERRY: What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at work?!?
GEORGE: Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin!
JERRY: So, you're just taking off from work?
GEORGE: Yeah well, they won't know.  I got the car there.
JERRY: Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the verge of this big promotion?
GEORGE: My presence, in that office, can only hurt my chances.
[Elaine's office at J Peterman]
RECEPTIONIST: (on Intercom)  Sue Ellen Mishke to see you.
ELAINE:  Sue Ellen Mishke?  Ah, alright, send her in.
(Sue Ellen enters, wearing the brazier as a top, with a black blazer)
SUE ELLEN: Hi Elaine.
ELAINE: Hellllloo.
SUE ELLEN: I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd stop in, and thank you for your lovely gift.
ELAINE: Ohhhhh. You're....welcome.
SUE ELLEN: Is anything wrong?
ELAINE: Well, Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra.
SUE ELLEN: Oh, I know. Thanks again.
[The Rosses cabin]
GEORGE: This is the life! Isn't it, huh, kid?
SUSAN: Wanna check out a swap meet?
GEORGE: Yeah, maybe. (snifs) Where'd you get that?
SUSAN: Oh, it was on the windshield of the car when we came out of that rest stop.
(George sits up suddenly; realizing something)
[Jerry's apartment, phone ringing]
(Jerry hits part of the phone receiver with his right hand to make the phone receiver pop up into the air -- he grabs it in his left and answers)
JERRY : Yello.
GEORGE: (on a pay phone) Hey, hey, it's George, I need ya to do me a favor.
JERRY: What's goin' on?
GEORGE: I just remembered, th-th-there's this Chinese restaurant out near Yankee Stadium, that puts flyers on all the cars.
JERRY: Yeah, so?
GEORGE: Alright, this is what ya gotta do: I need ya to go out to the parking lot at Yankee Stadium, take the flyers off my car.
JERRY: You know last time you had me throwin' a rye bread up three floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off your car, where does it end?!?
GEORGE: Alright, fine. I'll drive the 3 hours each way, 6 hours all together, and take 'em off myself!!
JERRY: Alright, alright, I'll do it!!
(Jerry hangs up, Kramer enters Jerry's apartment)
KRAMER: Oowe (Kramer noise -- he's eating something)
JERRY: Hey, what are ya up to?
KRAMER: Nothin'.
JERRY: You wanna go with me up to (clap) the Bronx and see if there's any flyers on George's car.
KRAMER (excited): Sure!
JERRY: I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I? (throws coat over his right shoulder)
KRAMER: yep.
(As they turn to go out the door, Kramer walks into the wall where the intercom is -- Jerry is pulling the door shut and Kramer avoids touching any part of the door, he turns quick as it shuts.)
[Exterior of Yankee Stadium then to the parking lot.]
(George's windshield is has a lot of flyers on it and the car is covered with bird droppings -- a bunch of pigeons are on the roof)
JERRY: Oh, man, look at this mess!  You know what's gonna happen if they see this?
KRAMER: Wheehh
JERRY: What are we gonna do?
KRAMER: I don't know.
JERRY: Well, we gotta get it washed (pulls off a few flyers)....Ah, the keys are locked inside!
KRAMER: Wait a second....
JERRY: What are ya gonna do?
KRAMER: I'll just snag the lock with this. auhh…  Here we go...
JERRY: Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?
[Leaving the Gentle Touch Car Wash: Jerry and Kramer driving George's car. Kramer is behind the wheel.]
KRAMER: Well, George has gotta be happy about this.
JERRY (indifferent): Yeah, yeah, yeah...
JERRY: Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?
(Sue Ellen is seen walking down the street)
KRAMER:  Oh, mama.
JERRY: Kramer!!! (Jerry points to the lamp post they are about to crash into)
(Car crash sound)
[Jerry's Apartment]
ELAINE: My God, are you okay?
KRAMER: Well I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder. (He has a large Band-aid on his forehead)
JERRY: I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it.
ELAINE: So how did this happen?
JERRY: He was starin' at some woman!
KRAMER: Well I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing.
ELAINE: What woman?
JERRY: There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing *just* a bra.  I can't get that image out of my mind.
ELAINE:  Oh...my God.
JERRY: What?
ELAINE: Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?
JERRY: Yeah!
ELAINE: Ohhh!  That's Sue Ellen Mishke!
JERRY: Sue Ellen Mishke?
ELAINE: That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top!  The woman is walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on, she's a menace to society.
KRAMER: Hey you know, my arm really hurts.  I wonder if its gonna affect my golf swing.
(Kramer makes a horrible golf swing motion and collapses in pain over the back of the couch.)
KRAMER: Oohh.
(Stan the caddy enters)
STAN (out of breath): I got your message, how's the shoulder?
KRAMER: Yeah, it's my left arm, I can't swing it!
STAN: Oh, no. Not the left arm!
KRAMER: Well what happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour, and all my dreams?
ELAINE: Oh! I got it! Let's sue her!
KRAMER: Sue her?
ELAINE: Yeah, she's loaded.  She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
KRAMER: Ah, No, no, no, I can't. I learned my lesson from that coffee company.
ELAINE: Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.  Your dreams have been shattered, somebody's got to be held accountable. Come on, we'll take for every penny she's got!
KRAMER: What do you think, Stan?
STAN: Let's go for the green! You know a good lawyer?
(Kramer smiles)
[Jackie Chiles' office]
JACKIE: So you're driving in the car, you're with your friend, minding your own business?
KRAMER: Yeah.
JACKIE: Then what happened?
KRAMER: Well then we saw this woman, and she was wearing a bra with no top.
JACKIE: No top?  She didn't have a top on?
KRAMER: Yeah. So I got distracted and I crashed the car.
JACKIE: Well how would you describe this woman?  Would you say she was an attractive woman?
KRAMER: Oh, yeah.
JACKIE: So we got an attractive woman, wearing a bra, no top, walkin' around in broad daylight.  She's flouting society's conventions!
KRAMER: She was flouting.
JACKIE: That's totally inappropriate. It's lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!
KRAMER: It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
JACKIE: Could you repeat that?
KRAMER: I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
JACKIE: O'Henry?  That's one of our top-selling candy bars.  It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat, it's delicious, scrumptious, outstanding!  Have you been to a doctor?
KRAMER: No.
JACKIE (speaking to the intercom): Susie, call Dr. Bison, set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer, tell him it's for me.
KRAMER: So whadda ya think, Jackie? I mean we got a case?
JACKIE: Like taking candy from a baby.
(Kramer mouths "Oh Yea" then motions his hand in a circle and clicks)
[The cabin]
GEORGE: I think I got it.  How 'bout this? How 'bout this? We trade Jim Leyritz and Bernie Williams, for Barry Bonds, huh?  Whadda ya think? That way I have Griffey and Bonds, in the same outfield! Now you got a team! Ha ha ha.
SUSAN: I don't know, George. I'm still worried about this car thing.
GEORGE: Oh, would ya stop worrying?
SUSAN: Well, what about the flyers?
GEORGE: Jerry took the flyers off the car, I got the whole thing covered.
[Yankee Stadium parking lot]
(Jerry having difficulty parking the car. Lots of smoke is coming from the vehicle. After getting the car in the space and hitting the Costanza parking sign, Jerry leans against the door, trying to close it.  Finally he gives up and leaves, kicking a piece of the car under it as he goes)
[Yankee Stadium, Steinbrenner's office, someone is knocking]
STEINBRENNER: Come in!
(Wilhelm enters)
STEINBRENNER: Ah, Wilhelm.
WILHELM: Mr. Steinbrenner, I am very concerned about George Costanza.
STEINBRENNER: How 'bout a 'good morning'?
WILHELM: Oh yes sir, good morning, good morning, sir.
STEINBRENNER: Good morning to you, Wilhelm.
WILHELM: Uh-a Anyway, his car's in the parking lot, the front end is bashed in, and there's blood in the car, and we can't find him anywhere. Obviously he was in some sort of a terrible car accident, and trooper that he is, he tried to make it into work, sir.
STEINBRENNER: Alright, Wilhelm, listen to me. I want the stadium scoured. He could be bleeding to death in the bullpen.
WILHELM: Yes sir. (he starts backing up to the door.)
STEINBRENNER: Put everyone on alert, check all the area hospitals, clinics, shelters, we've gotta find that kid.
WILHELM: Yes sir, yes sir. (Opening the door)
STEINBRENNER: We must find George.
WILHELM: Yes sir.
STEINBRENNER: Find him, Wilhelm!
(Wilhelm closes the door)
WILHELM: (from behind the closed door in the hallway)Yes sir.
[The hallway in Jerry's building]
(As Jerry walks down the hall to his apartment, he finds Sue Ellen knocks 14 times on Kramer's door)
SUE ELLEN: Excuse me, do you happen to know the gentleman across the hall?
JERRY (mesmerized): Yes, yes, I do.
SUE ELLEN: Do you happen to know if he'll be back anytime soon?
JERRY: No, I don't.
SUE ELLEN: Oh...
JERRY: Is there, something I can help you with?
SUE ELLEN: No, I really just needed to speak with him. (exhales)
JERRY: Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.
SUE ELLEN: Oh, well maybe I will.
(Jerry quickly unlocks his door, before she can change her mind)
SUE ELLEN: If you don't mind.
JERRY: No, no, not at all.
SUE ELLEN: Thanks.
JERRY: I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
[Yankee Stadium, Steinbrenner's office, someone is knocking]
STEINBRENNER: What is with these people, all day long. Come in, come in.
WILHELM: Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, you know, w-we've searched everywhere, th-there's no sign of him. n-n-Not even anyone who remotely fits his description, sir.
STEINBRENNER: Oh my God. Do you know what this means, Wilhelm?
WILHELM: What, sir?
STEINBRENNER: He's dead! ca-Costanza's dead!
WILHELM: No no no sir. Well, you see, I don't think--
STEINBRENNER: Oh, as quickly as he came here, he's gone. The poor little guy! Easy.  Easy, big Stein, get it together.  Ok, Wilhelm.
WILHELM: Yessir?
STEINBRENNER: Find out where his parents live.
WILHELM: Parents.
STEINBRENNER: I'm gonna personally notify them. ...and, ah, line up some candidates to fill that assistant to the General Manager position…
WILHELM: Yessir. (he starts backing up to the door.)
STEINBRENNER: we can't grieve forever!
WILHELM: Right. Yessir.
STEINBRENNER: We gotta get back to business!
WILHELM: Yes Sir! (closes the door)
STEINBRENNER: Back to Business Wilhelm!
WILHELM: (from behind the closed door in the hallway) Yes Sir!
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Kramer enters, he still has the Band-aid on his forehead)
KRAMER: Well, buddy, (claps) he's taking the case!  Jackie Chiles is right on it!  Right on it, he's all over it!
JERRY (not happy): Oh, really?
KRAMER: Why, wh-wh-what's wrong, come on?
JERRY: I don't know…
KRAMER: uuh-
JERRY: …so the woman was walking around in a bra…
KRAMER: Yeah-
JERRY: … I mean it's no big deal. You're still drivin'. You should have been watching the road.
KRAMER: Well, your attitude has certainly changed.
JERRY: I don't think my attitude has changed.
KRAMER: Now listen, Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify.
JERRY: (quietly, yet in a high and whiney tone) Well, I don't know if I....
KRAMER: Jerry, Jerry, you gotta testify!
JERRY: Kramer I don't think I can--
KRAMER: Listen, this is a million dollars we're talkin' about, Jerry, now this is the big league, the big time, now I need you on my team, Jerry!
JERRY: Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer.
KRAMER: Alright what's gotten into you, what's happened?!?
JERRY: Nothing's happened.
KRAMER (in disgust): Goohhhhck.
(As Kramer begins to leave, he notices an O'Henry wrapper in the garbage can)
KRAMER (picking up the wrapper): Ohhhh, what's this?
JERRY: Oh, no, no, no, wait a second, wait a second… th-th-that--
KRAMER: Oh I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't she?
JERRY: Kramer, it is not what you think.
KRAMER: Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh!  I know what I think.  I think you're gaga over this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger, and now, you're willing to sell me, and Elaine, and whoever else you have to, right down the river.
JERRY: And what about yooou?!?  Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard-working Americans!
KRAMER: You're just out for sex!!
JERRY: You're just out for money!!
KRAMER and JERRY (together): Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh!!!!!!
[The Costanza house, Queens]
(Steinbrenner is knocking, Estelle opens the door)
STEINBRENNER: Mrs. Costanza?
ESTELLE (smiling): Yesss?
STEINBRENNER: My name is George Steinbrenner, I'm afraid I have some very sad new about your son.
ESTELLE: (gasps)
(Costanza living room)
ESTELLE (crying): I can't believe it, he was so young.  How could this have happened?
STEINBRENNER: Well, he'd been logging some pretty heavy hours, first one in in the morning, last one to leave at night.  That kid was a human dynamo.
ESTELLE: Are you sure you're talking about George?
STEINBRENNER: You are Mr. and Mrs. Costanza?
FRANK (yelling): What the hell did you trade Jay Buener for?!?  He had 30 home runs, and over 100 RBIs last year. He's got a rocket for an arm - - you don't know what the hell you're doin'!!
STEINBRENNER: Well, Buhner was a good prospect, no question about it. But my baseball people love Ken Phelps' bat.  They kept saying 'Ken Phelps, Ken Phelps'.
[Jerry entering his apartment, as Frank is leaving a message on his answering machine]
JERRY'S OUTGOING MESSAGE: "I'm not here, leave a message."
FRANK (from the answering machine): Jerry, it's Frank Costanza, Mr. Steinbrenner's here, George is dead, call me back!
(The phone rings again, Jerry takes off his coat and throws his keys on the table.)
JERRY (answering phone): Hello?
GEORGE (on a pay phone): Hey, it's George.
JERRY: Where have you been?!?
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: I just got the most bizarre message from you father, Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!
GEORGE: Dead?
JERRY: Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a, it's a little crumpled.
GEORGE: My car's a little crumpled?!?
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!
GEORGE: Allright, I gotta head back right away, I'll-I'll -- I gotta figure something out here.
JERRY: Well you gotta call your parents.
GEORGE: I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there!
JERRY: Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?
GEORGE: OOuuoo!  They could use the break!
(George hangs up the phone. Jerry holds the cordless phone way and makes a facial expression like "well that's true.")
[Elaine's office at J Peterman. She is at her desk, Peterman enters]
PETERMAN (holding up a bra): Elaine, do you see this?  Do you see what I'm holding in my hands?
ELAINE: Yeah, it's a bra.
PETERMAN: I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top. (sits on the corner of the desk) What exquisite beauty, I ran down the hallway to talk to her, but the elevator door closed. It was not to be. Perhaps our paths will cross again some day.
ELAINE: w-What is this all about?
PETERMAN: I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's fashion.
ELAINE: Oh-oh, but-
PETERMAN: We're gonna sell this as a top. Here's the angle: Zelda Fitzgerald, aaaand, somebody in the 20s, wearing this at wild parties, driving all the men crazy (tosses the bra on Elaine's desk)… Have it on my desk by the end of the week.
(Peterman leaves as Elaine looks up in disbelief.)
[Yankee Stadium, Steinbrenner's office, someone is knocking]
STEINBRENNER: Come in, come in.
(George enters, with a bandage on his head, walking with crutches)
GEORGE: Mr. Steinbrenner--
STEINBRENNER (shocked): Ahhh, Ahhh!  Ah, ah ah!  Is it you?
GEORGE: Yeah, it's me sir.  It's been a harrowing few days. uuh, After the car accident, I-I crawled into a ditch, and managed to survive on, grubs and puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.
STEINBRENNER: Grubs, huh? Gotta admit, I never tasted one of those.
GEORGE: Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I-I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up that much.
STEINBRENNER: Well, don't tell it to me George, tell it to the new Assistant to the General Manager.
GEORGE: I didn't get the job?
STEINBRENNER: Well, once you were dead, we couldn't just sit on our hands.  We had to make a move...
(Dejected, George turns to leave, no longer walking with he crutches, and takes the bandage off his head)
STEINBRENNER: But, you still have your old job.  Of course, we'll have to dock you for the time you missed.  We're running a ball club here.  If I give special treatment to you, everyone will want it. Next thing you know its chaos!  And I can tell you this, (George closes the door) chaos does not work for the New York Yankees!  Not as long as I'm running the show!
[Courtroom]
JACKIE: So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy the bra for Miss Mishke, would you say that was correct?
ELAINE (on the witness stand): Yes...ummm, (leans into the microphone, pulling it closer it squeaks) yes, that's correct.
(Sue Ellen leans back and smiles at Jerry, Kramer wearing his arm in a sling notices and seems worried)
JACKIE: And you have also brought with you, another bra, (goes over to the table and pulls a bra out of a bag) exactly like, the one that she so flagrantly exhibited herself in!
ELAINE: Yes, that's correct.
(Kramer is now on the witness stand)
JACKIE: Uh, what was you golf score, the last round you played… uh, before you shoulder was injured?
KRAMER: Three under par.
(Stan nods proudly)
JACKIE (impressed): Oooohhhh, three under par, Hmm…That's what the professionals shoot, isn't it?
KRAMER: Well if they're lucky.
(Stan laughs, Elaine and Jerry are also amused. Kramer smiles and nods.)
(Jerry is now on the witness stand)
JACKIE: Well would you tell this jury exactly what you saw at the corner of 83rd Street and Columbus?
JERRY (hesitant): I...don't remember.
JACKIE: Well, did you, or did you not, see the defendant, wearing the bra?
JERRY: I don't know.  Maybe.
JACKIE: Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath.  Now I ask you again, did you or did you not, see this woman wearing a bra?!?
(shots of Sue Ellen, Kramer, Elaine and Stan waiting for Jerry's response.)
JERRY: ....Alright, alright, I saw her!…
(Sue Ellen rolls her head around in disbelief)
JERRY: And she was beautiful in that bra!  I'm crazy about her!  I love her whole free swinging, free wheeling attitude!
JUDGE (banging his gavel): This court will come to order!
JACKIE: No further questions, your honor.
JUDGE: You may step down.
JACKIE: Well Kramer, I think we got this wrapped up.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah...What's your read, Stan?
STAN: You're close, you're on the green. You just have to go for the cup.
KRAMER: What do you mean?
STAN: Have her try on the bra, see if it fits.
JACKIE: No, no, no, no!
KRAMER: Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man.
JACKIE: Stan? Who the hell is Stan?
KRAMER: He's my caddy.
JACKIE: You're caddy?!?  This is a big mistake!
KRAMER: Gu-gu- cada-
JACKIE: Your honor, we request at this time, that Miss Mishke...try on the bra.
JUDGE: (bangs the gavel twice) This court will come to order!  Go ahead Miss Mishke, try it on.
(Sue Ellen proceeds to try on the bra, over her top, but it seems too small. She cannot get the clasps to meet in the front.)
SUE ELLEN: Uhhh-Ah, it doesn't fit...I, I-I can't put it on.
JACKIE (to Kramer and Stan):  Damn fools!  Look at that!  We got nothin' now, nothin'! I've been practicing law for 25 years, you're listenin' to a caddy!
KRAMER: OK, OK-
JACKIE : This is a public humiliation!  You can't let the defendant, have control of the key piece of evidence. Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard, of course a bra's not gonna fit on over a leotard.  A bra's gotta fit right up against a person's skin, like a glove!
(Jackie raises his hand up -- the back of his hand to Kramer)
[Elaine's office]
(Two women enter wearing bras as tops)
WOMAN #1: Oh, hey, Elaine, how 'bout some lunch?
ELAINE: Oh, no, I-I don't think so.
WOMAN #2: Great job on the Gatzby Swing Top.  It's a winner.
ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, thanks.
WOMAN #1: Are you sure you don't wanna go?  We have reservations.
ELAINE: Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.
WOMAN #1: Ciao.
WOMAN #2: Ba-bye.
(Elaine makes a gun with her fingers and points it to her head)
[Nightclub]
Jerry's standup piece.
I love it when people are complimented on something they're wearing and they accept the compliment as if it was about them. "Nice tie." "Well, thank you. Thank you very much." The compliment is for the tie, it's not for you, but we take it. That's kind of the job of clothes; to get compliments for us, because it's very hard to get compliments based on your human qualities. Right? Let's face it, no matter how nice a person you are, nobody's gonna come Say "Hey, nice person." It's much easier to be a bastard and just try and match the colours up.
[Antique Toy Store]
(Elaine and Jerry enter a store stocked with the toys of yesteryear. They look around at the array of classic teddy bears, toy boats, puppets, etc.)
ELAINE: (awed) Oh, look at this!
JERRY: Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.
(Something on the wall catches Elaine's eye. It's an old-fashioned girl's bicycle, with high handlebars, a pink frame and a basket on the front.)
ELAINE: (excited) Oh, cool! Look at that!
(Jerry looks over, but his eye is drawn more towards an attractive woman, Christie, who stands looking at the toys. She's wearing a dress of mid-thigh length, black from the bottom of the ribs down, and white on the chest and arms.)
JERRY: (admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.
ELAINE: (excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
(Christie leaves her examination of the toys on that side of the store, and walks over to some other items. Jerry watches her as she goes, she notices and smiles and flirtatious looks are exchanged. Jerry is oblivious to Elaine's voice.)
ELAINE: What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?
JERRY: (tearing himself away from Christie) Huh?
ELAINE: What d'you think?
JERRY: Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.
ELAINE: (laughs) I love it. I'm getting it.
(Elaine reaches for the bike, as Jerry turns back to Christie.)
ELAINE: Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.
CHRISTIE: I think your friend needs some help over there.
JERRY: You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.
(Elaine gives up on Jerry assisting her and tries to lift the bike off the wall on her own. But as she raises it, the weight proves too much and she falls backwards, ending up on her back on the floor with the bike pinning her down. She struggles to lift it, but can't make much impression, so she rings the bell on the bike. Jerry finally has his attention drawn away from Christie.)
ELAINE: Hey!
(Elaine makes 'So, are you gonna help me?' gestures.)
[Restaurant]
(George and Susan are having dinner with Ken and Carrie. Carrie is heavily pregnant. George is eating spaghetti with his usual decorum.)
SUSAN: A little baby girl?
KEN: Doctor says it could be any day now.
GEORGE: (through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what does that make me?
CARRIE: Doesn't make you anything.
GEORGE: (jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.
(George laughs and shovels another load of pasta into his mouth. Ken and Carrie look perturbed.)
SUSAN: So, have you picked out a name yet?
CARRIE: Well, we've narrowed it down to a few. We like Kimberley.
SUSAN: Aww.
GEORGE: (negative) Hu-ho, boy.
KEN: You don't like Kimberley?
GEORGE: Ech. What else you got?
KEN: How about Joan?
GEORGE: Aw c'mon, I'm eating here.
SUSAN: (warning) George!
CARRIE: Pamela?
GEORGE: Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.
KEN: What?
GEORGE: Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.
CARRIE: I don't know, it sounds a little strange.
GEORGE: All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?
KEN: Yeah, but uh... Soda?
GEORGE: Yeah, that's right. It's working.
CARRIE: We'll put it on the list.
GEORGE: I solve problems. That's just what I do.
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry sits in front of the TV, while in the kitchen Kramer is building a sandwich of epic proportions. He hums to himself as he piles sliced meat onto bread. Jerry looks over at him, looking somewhat irritated by the way Kramer's demolishing his food stocks.)
KRAMER: (sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.
JERRY: You're really going to town with that turkey there.
KRAMER: Oh yeah, I got a big appetite.
(Kramer goes to the fridge and looks inside.)
KRAMER: Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh.
JERRY: It's on the door.
KRAMER: (examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff? No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.
(Kramer waves away the squeezy option and shuts the fridge.)
KRAMER: Ah, 's no good.
(Kramer goes back to his sandwich, puts the second slice of bread on, and takes a bite. It doesn't meet with his approval. He spits out the mouthful he's taken onto the plate, and dumps the rest of the sandwich next to it.)
KRAMER: No. That's bush league.
(Kramer heads toward the door.)
JERRY: Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? That's like half a pound of turkey!
KRAMER: No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without Dijon.
JERRY: (sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand.
KRAMER: Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy with our arrangement?
JERRY: What arrangement?
KRAMER: Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.
JERRY: (sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there and I will.
(Elaine enters. She has her head leaning over to the left, and she's moving carefully, like it's giving her pain.)
KRAMER: Oh, hey.
ELAINE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey. What's with your neck?
ELAINE: Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. (pointedly) By myself.
JERRY: Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.
ELAINE: (sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.
JERRY: Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.
ELAINE: Ach, maybe.
JERRY: Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
ELAINE: I don't know.
JERRY: Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned it...
ELAINE: (patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the hell up?
JERRY: Awright.
ELAINE: God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike to the first person who could make this pain go away.
KRAMER: Aw, you really hurting, huh?
ELAINE: Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.
KRAMER: Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted.
(Kramer walks around behind the seated Elaine, and reaches for her neck.)
KRAMER: Alright, lean forward, relax.
ELAINE: (worried) What? What?
KRAMER: Encounter shiatsu.
(Kramer begins to work at Elaine's neck with his thumbs.)
ELAINE: Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?
KRAMER: (continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.
ELAINE: Ah hah.
KRAMER: (to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
ELAINE: (seriously worried) Wha...?
KRAMER: He's a genius. Here we go...
(Kramer takes a firm grip of each side of Elaine's head. Elaine looks really worried now. She grabs a hold of Jerry's shirt and the arm of the couch, and her feet stamp on the floor.)
KRAMER: From pain, will come pleasure.
Kramer violently twists Elaine's head to the left. There's a loud crunching sound, and Elaine cries out in shock. Kramer lets go of her head and steps away, job done.)
KRAMER: Uh? Voila.
ELAINE: (pleasantly surprised) Oh my god!
KRAMER: Yeah.
(Elaine rolls her head around, completely comfortable.)
ELAINE: Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
JERRY: What's even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics.
KRAMER: Awright, my work is done here.
(Kramer heads for the door.)
ELAINE: (big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you!
KRAMER: (closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time.
ELAINE: (after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?
JERRY: I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck.
ELAINE: You really think he wants the bike?
JERRY: Oh yeah.
ELAINE: It took him like ten seconds!
JERRY: Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
[George's Car]
(George and Susan, heading home from the restaurant. George is happy, smiling and whistling.)
GEORGE: I think they really went for that Soda.
SUSAN: What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring you.
GEORGE: Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.
SUSAN: I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda.
GEORGE: Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?
SUSAN: Yeah.
(George uses his finger to draw a number 7 in the air, accompanying the strokes of his digit with a two-tone whistle.)
SUSAN: What is that? Sign language?
GEORGE: No, Seven.
SUSAN: Seven Costanza? You're serious?
GEORGE: Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
(Susan scoffs.)
GEORGE: ...especially a girl. Or a boy.
SUSAN: I don't think so.
GEORGE: What, you don't like the name?
SUSAN: It's not a name. It's a number.
GEORGE: I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute.
SUSAN: It's awful. I hate it!
GEORGE: (angry) Well, that's the name!
SUSAN: (also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to be named Seven!
GEORGE: (yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all crazy on me!
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry walks from the bathroom, talking to George, who's just told him about his contretemps with Susan.)
JERRY: Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.
GEORGE: (adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name than Seven.
(Jerry walks toward the kitchen. He sees an item on the counter.)
JERRY: Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh, Ketchup? Pretty name for a girl.
GEORGE: Alright, you having a good time there?
(Jerry is in the kitchen, and opens a cupboard. His eyes run over the array of good within.)
JERRY: I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.
GEORGE: (shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, Jerry. I had this name for a long time.
(Jerry comes back into the living room. A thought occurs.)
JERRY: Oh, I forgot to call Christie.
GEORGE: Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
JERRY: Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.
GEORGE: And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do it!
JERRY: (smug) I'm not engaged.
(George gives Jerry a look. Kramer enters. He's carrying a small goldfish bowl, a pad and a pencil tied to the bowl by string.)
KRAMER: Ah, I got it.
JERRY: Got what?
KRAMER: (putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry. Refrigerator problem, is solved.
JERRY: Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.
KRAMER: Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I want.
(Kramer takes a cupcake from a box on the counter.)
KRAMER: Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One cupcake." And then I put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the bowl) There. Very simple.
JERRY: Sort of a mooching inventory.
KRAMER: No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em all up, and you give me the bill.
JERRY: Alright.
KRAMER: Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?
(George passes by as he goes to the fridge.)
JERRY: Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.
KRAMER: Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other at our word, all is lost.
(George has fetched a Diet Coke from the fridge. He opens it. Kramer hears the hiss, and notices George.)
KRAMER: (waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.
[Restaurant]
(Jerry and Christie have just arrived. They're both wearing long coats, fastened to the collar.)
JERRY: Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city.
(A member of staff approaches.)
MAITRE D': May I take your coat, miss?
CHRISTIE: Yes, thank you.
(The Maitre d' helps Christie to slip out of her coat, revealing that she has on the exact same dress as she was wearing in the antique store. Jerry looks bemused, but plasters on a fixed smile as Christie looks at him.)
[Monks']
(Jerry and George sit in a booth, discussing the previous night. George fingers his chin thoughtfully.)
GEORGE: The same outfit?
JERRY: The exact same outfit.
GEORGE: How many days was it between encounters.
JERRY: Three.
GEORGE: Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got clean and she started all over again.
JERRY: Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?
GEORGE: Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
JERRY: Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?
GEORGE: Very curious.
JERRY: Indeed.
GEORGE: You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.
JERRY: Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.
GEORGE: (picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home.
JERRY: Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?
GEORGE: (standing) Not yet, but she's weakening.
JERRY: You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't destroy someone else's.
GEORGE: It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol.
JERRY: How about 'Mickey'?
GEORGE: 'Mickey'? (incredulous) 'Mickey'!
(George walks away, half-laughing at Jerry's ludicrous suggestion.)
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry is in the fridge. Kramer enters with a slide of the feet, and a cigar in his mouth.)
KRAMER: Hey buddy.
JERRY: (holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the fridge?
KRAMER: No, that's yours. My half is gone.
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your beef?
JERRY: You cannot buy half a can of soda.
KRAMER: Well, why not.
JERRY: Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?
KRAMER: Yeah.
JERRY: That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this, okay...
(Jerry holds up an apple, from which has been taken one large bite.)
JERRY: ...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana...
(Jerry hold up a half banana.)
KRAMER: Alright.
JERRY: ...You bite it, you bought it.
KRAMER: Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright.
JERRY: Thank you.
KRAMER: Yeah.
(Elaine enters.)
ELAINE: Hey.
KRAMER: Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?
ELAINE: Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike.
KRAMER: (deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
ELAINE: No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like saying, you're hungry enough to eat a horse.
KRAMER: Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher.
ELAINE: This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't have the bike.
KRAMER: Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine...
(Kramer holds one hand up above his head.)
KRAMER: I always put you up here...
(Kramer holds his other hand at about knee height.)
KRAMER: ...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww.
(Kramer brings his first hand down to the level of the second. He leaves, closing the door with a bang. Elaine sits, fighting with her conscience. There is a brief pause, then the door opens again and Kramer pokes in his head, expectantly.)
ELAINE: (grudging) Alright.
KRAMER: (points) Digidi.
(Kramer leaves and closes the door again.)
[Restaurant]
(George and Susan are having dinner.)
GEORGE: Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it.
SUSAN: Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more.
GEORGE: Why not?
SUSAN: Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told them the name, they just loved it.
GEORGE: So, what're you saying?
SUSAN: They're gonna name their baby Seven.
GEORGE: (disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, I made it up!
SUSAN: I can't believe that they're using it.
GEORGE: (anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose all its cachet!
SUSAN: I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
GEORGE: (rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the yin-yang!
[Elaine's Apartment]
(Elaine is in bed. She begins to move to get up. As she raises herself from the mattress, there is a loud crunching sound. A look of agony crosses her face.)
ELAINE: (in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!
[Street]
(Elaine walks along the street. Her neck problem means she has her head tipped back so far she can't see directly in front of her. A guy coming the other way gives her a warning.)
MAN: Watch your step.
(Elaine collides with a litter bin which is outside her field of vision.)
ELAINE: (pain) Oh, ah. (bitter) Stupid Kramer.
(Christie is looking in a shop window, then she spots Elaine.)
CHRISTIE: Excuse me. Elaine?
(Elaine, handicapped by her neck, cannot see who's speaking.)
ELAINE: Huh?
(Christie comes over to Elaine. All Elaine can see of her is her head and neck.)
CHRISTIE: Over here. I thought that was you. You're Jerry's friend, right?
ELAINE: Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?
CHRISTIE: Yes. How y'doing?
ELAINE: (bearing up) I'm fine.
CHRISTIE: Well, I gotta run. It was good to see you.
(Christie walks away.)
ELAINE: (after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.
(Kramer comes along the street, riding the Schwinn Stingray and ringing the bell. He attracts comments from folk on the street.)
VOICE 1 (O.C.): Lookin' good.
VOICE 2 (O.C.): Hey Cosmo, nice wheels.
KRAMER: You got that right!
(A kid leans out the window of a parked Volvo.)
KID: (scorn) Hey, you're riding a girl's bike.
(Kramer thumbs his nose and continues pedalling.)
ELAINE: (shouting) Kramer! Kramer!
[Outside Apartment Building]
(George walks up to the door. He pushes the buzzer for a particular apartment.)
KEN (O.C.): Hello.
GEORGE: Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk.
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry hears a loud knocking from the hallway.)
ELAINE (O.C.): (angry shout) Kramer!
(Jerry opens the door to reveal Elaine hammering insistently at Kramer's door.)
ELAINE: Kramer!!
JERRY: Hey
(Elaine turns to Jerry and gets a twinge from her neck.)
ELAINE: Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
(Elaine enters Jerry's apartment.)
JERRY: Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
ELAINE: His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was before.
(Elaine removes her bag from her back, wincing from the pain as she moves.)
JERRY: Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.
ELAINE: Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the antique store. What's her name, Christie?
JERRY: You saw her? What was she wearing?
ELAINE: I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck.
JERRY: Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?
ELAINE: What d'you care?
JERRY: Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
(There's a ringing from the Schwinn's bell, and Kramer rides it into Jerry's apartment. He rides all around the apartment, round the couch, past the TV and is heading for the door.)
ELAINE: Did you have a nice ride?
KRAMER: Oh, great ride.
ELAINE: Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!
(Elaine slams the door shut before Kramer can leave. Kramer rides straight into the door with a clatter. He falls to the ground, then makes his stumbling way upright again.)
KRAMER: What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
ELAINE: (anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.
KRAMER: Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week.
ELAINE: What? You never told me that.
KRAMER: Well, it's common sense.
ELAINE: Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.
KRAMER: Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should settle this.
ELAINE: Yeah Jerry.
JERRY: Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.
ELAINE: Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?
KRAMER: Alright, I'm down.
JERRY: Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind.
[Newman's Apartment]
(Elaine and Kramer sit on Newman's couch. Elaine with her head tilted back. Newman sits in his chair, his fingertips together, trying to give an impression of limitless wisdom.)
ELAINE: So, that's the situation.
NEWMAN: Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they don't belong!!...
KRAMER: Newman!
(Newman catches himself, and comes back to normality.)
NEWMAN: ...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?
KRAMER: Uh, yeah.
ELAINE: Yeah.
NEWMAN: Alright, let's begin.
(Newman sits back, to begin his contemplation. There is the single 'ting' of a microwave.)
NEWMAN: (excited) Ooh, my cocoa!
(Newman leaps to his feet and heads for his kitchen.)
[Ken and Carrie's Apartment]
(Carrie is on the couch, with Ken sitting on the arm. George is explaining about Seven.)
KEN: Why can't we use Seven?
GEORGE: It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
CARRIE: Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant. You've already postponed The wedding. Who knows if you'll ever get married.
GEORGE: Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle!
KEN: Right, we're both big Mickey Mantle fans, and we love the name. It's very unusual.
GEORGE: (shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on Soda.
KEN: (emphatic) Well, we don't care for Soda.
GEORGE: You don't care for Soda?!
CARRIE: (worked up) No, no. We don't like Soda at all!
GEORGE: (shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's refreshing!
(Carrie jumps and gives a cry.)
CARRIE: Oh!
KEN: What is it?
CARRIE: I felt something.
KEN: Are you okay, honey?
CARRIE: I think I'm going into labour.
(George flashes a panicked expression.)
KEN: Oh god, oh god. Okay, let's not panic. Let's just get to the hospital...
(Ken and Carrie rise and head toward the door.)
CARRIE: Okay.
KEN: ...Alright? I got the suitcase packed, right here.
(Ken grabs the suitcase from by the door and they exit, hurriedly. George trails along behind them, making suggestions.)
GEORGE: What about Six?
(Ken gives him a look over his shoulder.)
GEORGE: Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good.
(Ken has left, George follows out the door.)
GEORGE: Fourteen. (shouting after Ken) Fourteen!
(George closes the door behind him.)
[Restaurant]
(Jerry and Christie are having dinner. Christie is eating, while Jerry leans back picking at his meal, looking suspicious at the fact that Christie is wearing the same black and white dress as at their two previous meetings.)
CHRISTIE: Are you okay, Jerry? You seem quiet.
JERRY: No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.
CHRISTIE: I know exactly what you mean.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sure you do.
(Christie begins to season her food, with salt. Jerry chews thoughtfully.)
JERRY (V.O.): What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these, like Superman? I've got to unlock this mystery.
(Christie adds a little pepper to her dish. But after replacing the shaker, she knocks her glass of red wine over her dress.)
CHRISTIE: (horrified) Oh my god!
JERRY: Oh.
(Christie mops at the spill with her napkin, but there's only so much you can do.)
CHRISTIE: Ahh. I can't go to the movies like this. Do you mind if we go back to my apartment, so I can change?
JERRY: Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea.
[Ken and Carrie's Car]
(Ken is driving Carrie to the hospital. Carrie is as worked up as you'd expect a woman in labor to be. In the back seat, George is making one last attempt to save his name.)
CARRIE: Are we almost there?
KEN: Just keep breathing, okay.
CARRIE: (deep breaths) Okay, okay.
KEN: Okay.
GEORGE: (to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
(As George speaks, Ken is looking impatient and angry.)
KEN: Now's not the best time, George!
GEORGE: (to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy...
KEN: (firm) George! She's in labour!
GEORGE: (angry shout) So am I!
[Newman's Apartment]
(Elaine and Kramer still sit on the couch, awaiting Newman's arbitration.)
NEWMAN: Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?
(Kramer looks at Elaine, thinking his arguments have put him one up.)
NEWMAN: And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer. Not for any man...
(Kramer leans forward to receive the result. Elaine looks as attentive as she can while only being able to look upwards.)
NEWMAN: ...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.
ELAINE: (shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
(Newman's face drops at her negative reaction. Kramer looks across at the bike, looking worried.)
ELAINE: Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing in half.
KRAMER: No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.
ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, y-yeah.
NEWMAN: Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!
ELAINE: What?!
KRAMER: Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise.
(Kramer picks up the bike and climbs aboard.)
ELAINE: (frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bike?!
KRAMER: Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.
(Kramer opens the door and rides clumsily out, ringing the bell as he goes.)
[Christie's Apartment]
(Christie leads Jerry into her home.)
CHRISTIE: Here we are.
JERRY: (looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
(Christie puts down her bag, and removes her coat.)
CHRISTIE: Well, I guess I'll go change.
JERRY: Yes, change. By all means, change.
(Christie walks away down a hallway. Jerry removes his coat and sits down. He looks around himself. On the coffee table he notices a small framed picture of Christie and some guy. In the picture, she's wearing the same black and White dress. Jerry picks it up and examines it more closely, reading a date written on the photo.)
JERRY (V.O.): August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress! She never changes! Oh my god. (looking around) She's gotta have hundreds of these dresses.
(Jerry gets up from his seat.)
JERRY (V.O.): There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
(Jerry opens a closet and begins to look inside. While he's rooting about in there, Christie reenters the room, wearing a robe and looking indignant at discovering Jerry invading her privacy.)
CHRISTIE: Ahem! Are you looking for something?
JERRY: What're you doing? I thought you were changing.
CHRISTIE: No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night.
JERRY: No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.
CHRISTIE: If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to bed.
(Jerry moves to the couch, where he half lays down.)
JERRY: You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.
CHRISTIE: (unequivocal) Jerry. I don't think so.
(Jerry picks up his coat and moves toward the door.)
JERRY: You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
CHRISTIE: (gesturing) Get out.
(Jerry walks though the door. He's still talking as Christie closes it on him.)
JERRY: (pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you lay it out on the bed.
[Hospital]
(Carrie is in a wheelchair, being wheeled by an orderly. She's doing her breathing. Ken hurries alongside, comforting his wife. George also hustles along the corridor with the group.)
KEN: Okay, breathe, honey. Breathe.
GEORGE: (to Carrie) You know, you're really being very selfish. It would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!
CARRIE: (shouts) I'm having a baby!!
(The orderly pushes the wheelchair on through the door of the delivery room. Ken turns to face George.)
KEN: George, you're not getting Seven! Now get outta here!!
(Ken strides into the delivery room.)
GEORGE: (desperate) Please! I have so little!
(George tries to follow, but an orderly blocks his path.)
ORDERLY: Sorry sir, it's family only.
(The orderly closes the door on George, whose face can be seen through The window.)
GEORGE: I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
(George thumps his fists against the door in frustration. He's crying as He screams.)
GEORGE: Seven!!
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry is on the phone, while Kramer examines a box of cereal in the kitchen.)
JERRY: Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again? (listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone. C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me. (hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello.
(Defeated, Jerry hangs up the phone.)
KRAMER: (indicating the cereal) Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking on these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box.
JERRY: Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.
(Jerry tears a sheet off a writing pad, and presents it to Kramer. Kramer takes a look.)
KRAMER: (does a double take) Yikes.
JERRY: I know. Pretty steep.
KRAMER: Well, I don't have this kind of cash.
JERRY: Few do.
KRAMER: I'm good for it.
JERRY: Yeah, well, until this bill is paid...
(Jerry takes back the tab, then takes the cereal out of Kramer's hands.)
JERRY: ...the food court is closed.
KRAMER: (opening the door) Alright. I'll get that money for you in five minutes. And, don't eat any more.
(Kramer leaves at a run.)
[Street]
(Elaine is walking along, when she spots something ahead of her.)
ELAINE: Hey, that's my bike! Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn for all he's worth. He rings the bell.
NEWMAN: Gangway!
ELAINE: This is my bike!
(Newman brakes to a halt in front of Elaine.)
NEWMAN: Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make some minor modifications, you know. Solid tires, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
(Newman begins to ride away.)
ELAINE: (chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman, gimme...
(Elaine grabs hold of the trailing end of Newman's scarf.)
NEWMAN: Hey!! Help me!
(The show ends with a freeze frame of Newman on the bike, and a determined Elaine grasping the scarf. There are sounds of a struggle.)
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry enters, carrying a couple of bags and his mail. No sooner has he put his bags down than Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: Hey! You're back!
JERRY: Oh, I'm back, baby.
KRAMER: Yeah, how was it?
JERRY: Great. One of the best jobs I ever had.
KRAMER: Good for you.
JERRY: I killed.
KRAMER: You killed.
JERRY: (taking off his jacket) Slaughtered. Wiped the floor with 'em and (hanging up jacket) not only that, the money was unbelievable.
KRAMER: Unbelievable.
JERRY: Yeah. Highest paying job I ever had.
KRAMER: How much?
JERRY: (reluctant) Nah, nah. I'd rather...
KRAMER: Aw, c'mon.
JERRY: Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship.
KRAMER: I tell you how much I make.
JERRY: And I'm always impressed.
KRAMER: Just show me the cheque, c'mon.
JERRY: Awright, fine. You wanna see it?
KRAMER: I wanna see it.
JERRY: Okay.
(Jerry gets out his wallet, extracts a cheque from within it and hands it to Kramer.)
JERRY: Here, check that out.
(Kramer reads the cheque, and a look of astonishment comes to his face.)
KRAMER: (stunned) Whuf! This is unbelievable.
JERRY: I told you.
(Kramer has to sit on the couch, he's so shocked.)
KRAMER: My god, you're rich.
JERRY: (taking back the check) Oh yeah.
KRAMER: I didn't know you made that kinda money. (subdued) Jeez.
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior.
JERRY: I never shoulda told you.
KRAMER: You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?
JERRY: No, I can't feel anything.
KRAMER: Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?
JERRY: Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity.
KRAMER: (pleased) Really?
JERRY: (deadpan) No.
KRAMER: Well, you should, Jerry.
JERRY: No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car.
KRAMER: Now, you see, that's nice.
JERRY: Maybe a Cadillac.
KRAMER: (smiles) Cadillac. Ooh-la-la.
JERRY: Yeah. (thinking) That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. (decisive) I'm gonna do it.
KRAMER: You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one.
JERRY: Oh, isn't that what it's all about?
(Kramer and Jerry smile in agreement.)
[Monk's]
(Elaine sits in a booth, across from her friend Katy.)
ELAINE: Who was Pippi Longstocking?
KATY: Pippi Longstocking? (thoughtful) Hmm, I don't don't know.
ELAINE: Did she have anything to do with Hitler?
KATY: Hitler? (thinks) Maybe.
(George enters and walks over to the booth. He's looking impatient.)
GEORGE: Hey.
ELAINE: Hey George.
GEORGE: Have you seen Jerry? (sitting beside Elaine) I told him two o'clock.
(George twists round, so he can watch the door.)
ELAINE: (indicating) You remember Katy?
GEORGE: (distracted) Mm? (acknowledges Katy) Oh, hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We met uh, skiing that time. You're uh, married to the eye guy.
KATY: Also ear, nose and throat.
GEORGE: Nose. (chuckles) What's the worst that can happen to a nose? What does it get? Stuffed? (chuckles)
KATY: (amused) He's funny.
ELAINE: Ah, you don't have to tell me.
GEORGE: Ahh, ladies, please, please. (chuckles)
ELAINE: Oh, you know what? He got engaged.
KATY: Oh, you did? (disappointed) Oh.
GEORGE: What? Is that bad?
KATY: I actually would've set you up with a friend of mine.
GEORGE: Oh-ho, yeah?
KATY: You'd be perfect for her. She loves quirky, funny guys.
GEORGE: (curious) Bald? Uh?
KATY: Loves bald.
GEORGE: Loves bald? (laughs) Wow. Who uh, who is she?
KATY: Marisa Tomei.
GEORGE: (taken aback) The actress?
KATY: Yeah.
GEORGE: You're friends with Marisa Tomei?
KATY: That's right.
GEORGE: (getting excited) That's, that's incredible. My Cousin Vinnie, I love her, she was fantastic!
KATY: Yeah, I know.
GEORGE: (more excitement) You were gonna fix me up with her?
KATY: Yeah, she's just been sitting home.
GEORGE: (fever pitch) Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine! Wh..why didn't you tell me that Katy was friends with Marisa Tomei?!
ELAINE: (deadpan) Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry is talking on the phone as George enters and hangs up his coat.)
JERRY: I want this baby fully loaded. (listens) Well, how soon can you get it there? (listens) Oh, that's terrific. (listens) Okay, thanks, bye.
(Jerry hangs up and turns to George.)
JERRY: Hey, guess what. I just bought my father a Cadillac
GEORGE: Really? Wow, you're quite the good son.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him.
(Jerry walks to the kitchen.)
GEORGE: You gonna sleep on the fold-out?
JERRY: (joyless) Yeah, yes.
(Jerry opens the fridge door and gets out a piece of pie on a plate.)
GEORGE: Uh, let me ask you something. You uh, you ever hear of Marisa Tomei?
JERRY: The actress?
GEORGE: Yeah. She's uh, she's something, isn't she?
JERRY: Oh yeah.
GEORGE: Well, you know Katy, Elaine's friend?
JERRY: Yeah?
GEORGE: She happens to be very good friends with her.
JERRY: Marisa Tomei?
GEORGE: Uh-hmm.
JERRY: How does she know Marisa Tomei?
GEORGE: I don't know, I didn't ask.
JERRY: You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?
GEORGE: Not the point!
JERRY: Alright.
GEORGE: Can I finish?
JERRY: Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I would've asked her.
(Jerry opens the freezer compartment and gets out a tub of ice cream.)
GEORGE: Alright! So, she said, that she could've fixed me up with her.
JERRY: What d'you mean, could've?
GEORGE: Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged.
JERRY: Ohh!
GEORGE: Coulda fixed me up with Marisa Tomei. She said I was just her type!
JERRY: Really?
(Jerry puts a scoop of ice cream on the pie.)
GEORGE: (getting animated) Yeah. Yeah. You know the odds of me being anyone's type?! I have never been anyone's type, but apparently, this Marisa Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men.
JERRY: You know, she won an academy award?
GEORGE: (sarcasm) Hu-hu, like I don't know that? (excitement) My Cousin Vinnie, I love that! I, George Costanza, could be on a date with an Oscar winner! An Oscar winner, Jerry! You know what that's like? It's like if fifty years ago, someone fixed me up with Katherine Hepburn? Same thing!
JERRY: Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.
GEORGE: I mean, you've seen her, right?
JERRY: Katherine Hepburn? Oh yeah.
GEORGE: (shout) Marisa Tomei!
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
GEORGE: I mean, she's beautiful, right? She's just my type. The dark hair, the full lips.
(George wanders to the couch, Jerry following with his plate of pie and ice cream.)
JERRY: You like full lips.
GEORGE: Oh, I love full lips. Something you can really put the lipstick on.
(The two sit on the couch.)
JERRY: Mmm-mmm. Too bad you're engaged.
(Jerry takes a mouthful of pie.)
GEORGE: (downcast) Yeah, too bad. Too bad.
(There is a knock at the door.)
JERRY: (about the pie) This is no good.
(Jerry puts down the plate, gets up and opens the door, to reveal a guy in a Plaza Cable cap.)
JERRY: Hi.
NICK: Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm uh, I'm with Plaza Cable. I'm sorry to bother you. I...I'm looking for the guy who lives over here. Been waiting about uh, heh, two hours. You uh, happen to know where he is?
JERRY: No.
NICK: If you see him, Could you just tell him the cable company was here?
JERRY: Sure.
NICK: Thanks.
(The guy leaves. Jerry closes the door and returns to the couch.)
JERRY: (about the cable guy) Nice people.
(Jerry sits beside George again.)
GEORGE: Listen, lemme ask you a question. What if I got a cup of coffee with her?
JERRY: Well, what about Susan?
GEORGE: (worked up) I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not allowed to have coffee?!
JERRY: Would you tell Susan about it?
GEORGE: (frustrated) Not necessarily.
JERRY: Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.
GEORGE: (shouts) Of course there's something wrong! (points at Jerry) We had a pact!
(Jerry heads for the fridge, just as Kramer enters.)
JERRY: Hey, cable guy's looking for you.
KRAMER: Oh, yeah?
JERRY: Yeah.
KRAMER: Oh. Yeah, I been getting HBO and Showtime for free. See, they just found out about it, so now they wanna come and take it out.
JERRY: Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out.
KRAMER: Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting.
JERRY: You don't seem too bothered by it.
KRAMER: You remember what they did to me ten years ago? "Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one", or "We'll be there between two and six"! (quiet anger) And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors. (malice) Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?
JERRY: Boy, I've never seen you like this.
KRAMER: Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side.
[George's Apartment]
(George sits on his couch, watching My Cousin Vinnie on video. Onscreen, Marisa Tomei, is in court, explaining transmission systems.)
MARISA: ...positrack, which was not available on the sixty-four Buick Skylark.
(Susan enters)
SUSAN: Hey. (glances at TV) Hey what're you watching? What is that? My Cousin Vinnie?
GEORGE: Yeah.
(Susan stands behind George as she speaks.)
SUSAN: I thought you saw that before. How come you're watching that again?
GEORGE: I..I..I dunno.
SUSAN: Did you know Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for that? Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think? I wish I looked like that.
(George daren't say anything, but from his expression it's clear he wishes Susan looked like that.)
SUSAN: Turn it off. You're making me jealous. I'm gonna think you like her more than you like me.
(Susan leaves to the bedroom.)
GEORGE: (forcing a laugh) Hu, ha.
(When Susan has gone, George picks up the phone and dials, keeping an eye open in case Susan returns.)
[George's Apartment/Elaine's Apartment]
ELAINE (O.C.): Hello.
GEORGE: (whispering) Elaine, it's me, George.
(Elaine is sitting up in bed, reading a newspaper as she speaks to George.)
ELAINE: George. How come you're whispering?
GEORGE: (still quiet) Never mind, never mind. I need you to do me a favour. Uhm, remember what we were talking about at the coffee shop earlier?
ELAINE: No.
GEORGE: (still quiet) Think, a second. You know, your friend was talking about me and, you know...
ELAINE: Ech, George, I have no idea what you're talking about.
GEORGE: (still quiet) The actress.
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: (shouts) Marisa Tomei!
(Susan hears from the bedroom.)
SUSAN (O.C.): What?
GEORGE: (calling to Susan) Uh, ah, nothing. Nothing.
ELAINE: Oh, yeah. Yeah, what about her?
GEORGE: Well, uhm, I think I'd like to do it.
ELAINE: What? (shocked) What?! George, no way. You're engaged!
GEORGE: A cup of coffee. That, that doesn't mean anything.
ELAINE: Uhh. No George!
GEORGE: Elaine.
ELAINE: Forget it!
(Elaine hangs up her phone in disgust.)
GEORGE: Elaine! (shouts) ELAINE!!
(Susan walks back in on George at this point. George quickly slips the phone under a cushion to conceal it, and goes back to watching My Cousin Vinnie, to provide an excuse for his raised voice.)
GEORGE: D'oh...Oh, oh, the judge! I hate this guy!
(Susan looks at him oddly.)
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry is packing some gear into a bag, while Elaine watches and Kramer peers out into the hall through Jerry's peephole.)
ELAINE: I can't believe you're buying your father a car.
JERRY: And, best of all, it's a Cadillac.
ELAINE: (sharp intake of breath) Hoh. A Cadillac! (impressed) Wow.
(Elaine seems to become a lot more interested in Jerry. She moves over to the table where Jerry's packing, and turns the 'flirt' knob to the 'on' position.)
ELAINE: I had no idea you had this kind of money.
JERRY: Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.
ELAINE: Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in this kind of, you know, uh... position.
JERRY: Ah, it's just money.
ELAINE: (smiling) So, when're you getting back from Florida?
JERRY: Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?
ELAINE: I don't know. (big smile) Just, things seem a little more exciting when you're around. That's all.
JERRY: Are you okay?
ELAINE: (squeaky) Sure, sure.
JERRY: What was that?
(Kramer sees something through the peephole. He motions Jerry and Elaine to quieten down.)
KRAMER: Quiet, quiet.
[Jerry's Apartment/Hall Outside Jerry's Apartment]
(Nick, the cable guy is standing by Kramer's door. George wanders up to Jerry's door and, as he gets there, is addressed.)
NICK: Hey, uh, you know the guy who lives here?
GEORGE: Yeah.
(George moves to open Jerry's door, but the cable guy is still talking.)
NICK: (quietly angry) All morning I been waiting here. All morning.
(Peering through the peephole, Kramer makes a noise of excited satisfaction.)
NICK: (still angry) The guy says he's gonna be home. I show up and all I do is wait. I'm getting pretty sick and tired of it. I'm not gonna put up with it much longer.
(The cable guy stalks away. Inside Jerry's, Kramer turns to speak to Jerry and Elaine.)
KRAMER: I'm loving this.
(Kramer lowers his eye to the peephole again, just as George opens the door. The door cracks Kramer on the forehead with a thump. George enters. Kramer peers round George to check the cable guy's gone.)
GEORGE: Kramer, there's a guy out here that...
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. I know, I know.
(Kramer exits and crosses the hall to his apartment. George closes the door behind himself, and takes off his coat. He notices Elaine.)
GEORGE: (pointedly to Elaine) Oh. Thanks very much for yesterday, by the way.
ELAINE: Jerry, he want me to fix him up with Marisa Tomei. I am not gonna be a part of this!
GEORGE: (animated) Fixed up? A cup of coffee! A cup of coffee is not a fix up!
ELAINE: You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you?
GEORGE: (defensive) So what? So what if I do?
ELAINE: (shrill) You're engaged!
GEORGE: (worked up) I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine. An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky, balding funny men!
JERRY: I notice you threw 'stocky' in there.
GEORGE: Yeah, what the hell?!
ELAINE: George! It's cheating.
GEORGE: (adamant) It's not cheating if there's no sex!
ELAINE: Yes it is!
GEORGE: (frustrated) Ahh!
ELAINE: (looking for support) Jerry!
(Jerry is standing by the kitchen counter. He has a stack of bank notes and is counting them. Elaine is mesmerised by the sight of all that currency. She stands by the counter, her eyes locked onto the money.)
JERRY: Uhm, hold, hold on a second. (pauses counting) I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.
(Elaine looks almost dizzy at the prospect of all that cash.)
GEORGE: (pleading) Elaine, c'mon. Would you just make the call? (indicates the phone) Please, make the call.
ELAINE: (distractedly) Yeah, yeah, fine, I'll make...
(Elaine picks up the phone and dials a number.)
GEORGE: (triumph) Alright.
(Jerry resumes his counting, but has lost track of where he was up to. He stands, holding one bill, trying to recall. Elaine has obviously been paying more attention, even as she dialled the phone.)
ELAINE: Eight-fifty.
JERRY: Oh, right.
(Elaine waits for the phone to be picked up.)
ELAINE: So uh, how are you getting to the airport? D'you need a ride, or...
JERRY: No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car.
(As Jerry goes to leave the kitchen, Elaine is sure to keep in his path, smiling flirtatiously.)
ELAINE: You sure? You sure? 'Cos, you know...
JERRY: Maybe I'll let you pick me up.
ELAINE: (big smile) Okay.
(Jerry is finally allowed out of the kitchen by Elaine, and heads for the bedroom. The phone is picked up at the other end of Elaine's line. As Elaine speaks, George stands beside her, doing a little selection of dances.)
ELAINE: Oh, hi. Uhm, is Katy there? (listens) Wh...? Uhm, what? (listens) Oh, really?
(Something about the tone of her voice causes George to cease dancing.
ELAINE: Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks.
(Elaine turns to an expectant George.)
ELAINE: Huh, she's in the hospital. (concerned) She has an arrhythmia.
GEORGE: (impatient) What about Marisa Tomei?!
[Morty and Helen's, Florida]
(Morty is eating a cookie at the kitchen table. Helen comes over and grabs the box he's eating from.)
HELEN: Morty, what d'you have to open this box for? (waving at another box) There's already a box of cookies open.
MORTY: I wanted a Chip Ahoy.
HELEN: I don't like all these open boxes.
(Helen puts both boxes of cookies away in a cupboard.)
MORTY: Look, I got a few good years left. If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having it.
(The door opens and Jerry enters, carrying his bags.)
JERRY: Surprise!
MORTY: (shout) Jerry!
HELEN: (shock) Oh, my god!
MORTY: What the hell are you doing here?
JERRY: I'm a good son.
HELEN: Just like that? No calls?
JERRY: Just like that.
MORTY: Boy, you are really something.
HELEN: To what do we owe this great honour?
JERRY: You wanna know? Come on outside.
MORTY: Outside? What's going on?
HELEN: Whenever Jerry comes, something exciting happens.
(Helen darts out of the door eagerly.)
MORTY: (laughs) Heh hah!
JERRY: C'mon, c'mon.
(Morty follows Helen outside.)
[Outside Morty and Helen's, Florida]
(Standing at the kerb is a brand new, silver, Cadillac, gleaming in the Floridian sunshine. Jerry leads Morty and Helen over to it.)
JERRY: Well, what d'you think?
MORTY: Look at this! Look at this! (excited) You bought a Cadillac?!
JERRY: I bought it for you. It's yours.
(Morty and Helen both look astonished.)
MORTY: You what? You bought me a Cadillac?
JERRY: I bought you a Cadillac. (hands over the keys) Here you go.
HELEN: (sharply, to Jerry) Are you out of your mind?
JERRY: What?
MORTY: (to Helen) You don't want it? Are you kidding?
HELEN: He's not buying us a Cadillac.
MORTY: What are you, nuts?
HELEN: It's a very nice gesture Jerry, but take it back.
(Helen wrests the keys from Morty's grasp and hands them back to Jerry.)
MORTY: (to Jerry) Can you believe this?!
HELEN: I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of money.
JERRY: How d'you know?
HELEN: Oh, get out of here Mister Big Shot.
JERRY: Why can't I buy my father a car?
HELEN: Your father doesn't need a car.
MORTY: Yes, I do!
(Morty grabs the keys back from Jerry.)
HELEN: Oh, Morty.
MORTY: We're keeping it.
HELEN: Over my dead body.
(Helen makes another grab for the keys, and she and Morty struggle for possession, watched by Jerry.)
JERRY: (under his breath) Well, this worked out just as I had hoped.
[Kramer's Apartment]
(Kramer sits on his couch reading a newspaper. Beside him, on a table, are his phone and an answering machine. The phone rings, but Kramer doesn't answer, instead allowing the machine to pick up.)
MACHINE (KRAMER): Giddyup.
NICK (O.C.): Yeah, this is Nick Stevens, from Plaza Cable.
(Kramer smiles on hearing the voice.)
NICK (O.C.): Well, I waited all morning again. You said you were gonna be there from nine to one.
(Kramer puts down his paper and stretches out on the couch to listen.)
NICK (O.C.): I was there. Where were you? You think I got nothing better to do than stand outside all morning, waiting for you to show up?!
(Kramer waves his fist, mocking the cable guy's anger. He laughs to himself.)
NICK (O.C.): You're not gonna get away with this!
[Outside Morty and Helen's, Florida]
(Morty is sitting in the Cadillac, with Jerry leaning on the door. They're going through the features of the car.)
MORTY: Hey Jerry, look at this. My seat's got a memory, in case somebody moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes right back to where I like it.
JERRY: That's what I was thinking.
(Jack Klompus approaches the car.)
JACK: (pointing) Hello, Jerry.
JERRY: Hiya, Jack.
(Morty gets out of the car, shuts the door and leans against it.)
MORTY: (indicating) So, how d'you like this?
JACK: Who's car?
MORTY: It's mine.
JACK: Yours?
MORTY: That's right. My son bought it for me.
JACK: He what?
MORTY: My son bought me the car. It's a present.
JACK: (disbelief) You bought it?
JERRY: That's right. I bought it.
MORTY: You ever see one so nice?
JACK: Some car.
MORTY: You wanna take a ride?
JACK: No, thank you.
MORTY: C'mon, take a ride.
JACK: I don't wanna take a ride.
MORTY: Why not?
JACK: I don't feel like taking a ride. Do I have to take a ride?!
JERRY: He doesn't wanna take a ride.
MORTY: Uh huh.
JACK: (worked up) What d'you think? I've never ridden in a Cadillac before? Believe me, I've ridden in a Cadillac hundreds of times. Thousands.
MORTY: (skeptical) Thousands?!
JACK: What? D'you think you're such a big shot now, because you got a Cadillac?
MORTY: (dismissive) Ahh!
JACK: (dismissive) Yaah!
(Jack angrily stalks away.)
MORTY: Could you believe that guy?
JERRY: Aahh!
[Hospital Room]
(George sits, talking enthusiastically to someone.)
GEORGE: Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa.
(The person he's talking to is Katy, who's unconscious, wearing an oxygen mask and has an intravenous drip in her.)
GEORGE: You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but (laughs) uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say. (chuckles) Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. (chuckles) So, what d'you, what d'you think?
(Katy is still unconscious.)
GEORGE: (urgent) Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?
[Kramer's Apartment]
(Kramer is reading a magazine on the couch. The phone rings and he answers it.)
KRAMER: Y'hello.
NICK (O.C.): (inexpertly disguising his voice) Hi, uh ah, Mister Kramer, ah, this is McNab down at the phone company. We've got a report about some trouble on your line.
(Kramer smiles, as he recognises the voice.)
KRAMER: Hmm. Well, I haven't had any trouble.
NICK (O.C.): Uh, the thing is, we happen to have a man right in your neighbourhood.
(Kramer walks over to his window, and uses his fingers to open a couple of blades on his blinds. Peering through, he can see a public phone box across the street. Parked beside the box is a truck emblazoned with the Plaza Cable insignia, and in the box is the familiar figure of Nick, the cable guy.)
KRAMER: (playing along) Ohh, is that right? Well, I have been having a little trouble with my call-waiting.
NICK: We can fix that. We can fix that.
KRAMER: (sitting back on the couch) Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that.
NICK: Oh, right. (laughing it off) I'm sorry, I was looking at the wrong work order.
KRAMER: Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the stove.
(Kramer puts the phone down beside a radio and switches it on. It plays cheesy music into the phone. Kramer gets up and heads out the door.)
[Street]
(Nick, the cable guy, stands in the phone box. He's listening to the cheesy music on the phone, and getting impatient. He glances at his watch. Suddenly, a car horn blares and a shout is heard.)
KRAMER: Hey, McNab!
(The cable guy turns, to see Kramer leaning out of the window of a cab as it passes.)
KRAMER: Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?
(Kramer waves and smiles happily at the dumbstruck cable guy, as the cab accelerates away.)
[Tenant's Committee, Florida]
(Around a table sit a number of residents, including an unhappy looking Jack Klompus. Morty is standing behind a lectern addressing the gathering. He bangs a gavel to get their attention.)
MORTY: Alright. Next thing on the agenda, the restoration of the fence at the Briarwood gate. At the present time, we are still accepting bids.
HERB: C'mon Morty, it's been broken for six months already. What the hell are you doing?
MORTY: Well, I, as your president, have to find the best price, and right now, I for one, do not think it's cost-feasible.
JACK: (half to himself) I'll bet you don't.
MORTY: What was that?
JACK: C'mon Morty, the jig is up!
MORTY: What're you talking about?
JACK: I'm sorry. I'm sitting here, the whole meeting, holding my tongue. I've known you a long time, Morty, but I cannot hold it in any longer.
HERB: What's going on, Jack?
JACK: I'll tell you what's going on. Morty Seinfeld has been stealing funds from the treasury.
MORTY: Stealing?!
RALPH: What proof do you have?
JACK: Proof? You want proof? He's driving around in a brand new Cadillac. Now what more proof do you want?
MORTY: My son bought me that car!
JACK: Your son?
MORTY: Yeah.
JACK: Your son could never afford that car. We all saw his act, last year, at the playhouse. He's lucky he can pay his rent!
HERB: Jack's right! He stinks!
RALPH: It's his material.
MORTY: I tell you, he bought it for me!
HERB: (bangs table with his fist) I move for a full investigation!
RALPH: I second.
(Morty looks dumbstruck.)
[George's Apartment]
(George sits on the couch, watching Only You on the video. Onscreen, the ever-lovely Marisa is delivering her lines.)
MARISA: ...go introduce myself.
(Susan enters, with a bag of groceries.)
SUSAN: Hey! What're you watching? (looks at TV) Only You? That's another Marisa Tomei movie, and you've seen that one too. (jokingly) What, d'you have a thing for her?
GEORGE: (laughing it off and trying too hard) Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man. (forced laughter) Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner. (nervous laughter) He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei?
SUSAN: What are you talking about?
(Susan wanders away into the kitchen with the groceries, looking bemused by George. George watches her go, staring at the kitchen door as he slips off into a daydream.)
[George Dream Sequence]
(George stares at the kitchen door, which glows with golden light. Then Marisa Tomei slinks out of the kitchen in a long black dress, and her hair up. She comes and sits beside George on the couch, looking at him lovingly.)
MARISA: Have I told you how much I love you today?
GEORGE: Not in the last fifteen minutes.
MARISA: Well, I do love you very much.
GEORGE: And I love you, Marisa.
MARISA: Well then, c'mon, get dressed. We're going to be late for the premiere.
(George leans across and takes Marisa in his arms. They kiss and slowly recline onto the couch.)
[George's Apartment]
(Susan returns from the kitchen, to find George kissing, and slowly reclining onto the couch with, a cushion. George runs a hand across his head, in the fashion of a loving Marisa's caress. Then he raises his head from the cushion to see Susan observing him. She turns and goes back into the kitchen, wordlessly. George puts the cushion on the arm of the couch and lies down.)
[Morty and Helen's, Florida]
(Jerry sits on the couch and Helen is in the kitchen, as an anxious Morty delivers his news.)
HELEN: Impeachment?
MORTY: That's right. Have you ever heard of anything like that?
HELEN: Can they do that?
MORTY: If they get the votes.
HELEN: I told you we shouldn't have let him give us the car.
JERRY: Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it.
MORTY: It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots.
JERRY: You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!
MORTY: No-one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have to move to Boca.
(There's a knock at the door, and then it is opened and Evelyn walks in.)
EVELYN: Hello?
JERRY: Oh, hi Evelyn.
(Morty sits by the table.)
EVELYN: Hello, Jerry. (to the senior Seinfelds) I just got off the phone with Saul Brandus.
HELEN: What'd he say?
EVELYN: He's voting to impeach.
(Morty thumps the table with his fist.)
EVELYN: Not because he think you stole the money, but mainly because you never thanked him for giving you his aisle seat at Freddy Roman's show.
MORTY: I did so thank him!
HELEN: (admonishing) No, he never heard you. (prods Morty's back) I told you he didn't hear you.
MORTY: Ah, he's deaf anyway.
EVELYN: Now, my sources tell me, there's three votes for impeachment, three votes against impeachment, and one undecided.
MORTY: Who's that?
EVELYN: Mrs Choate.
JERRY: Who's she?
MORTY: Oh, that one. She's been a member of the board longer than anybody. She's very tough to deal with.
HELEN: Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and explain our side of it?
MORTY: That's a good idea.
EVELYN: Okay. I'll see you at the Lichtenberg's, tonight.
HELEN: (surprise) The Lichtenberg's?
EVELYN: Yes, they're having a party.
HELEN: We weren't invited.
EVELYN: Oh. Probably they think you're too good for them. You know, because of the car.
(Jerry puts his face in his hands.)
[Montage]
JERRY (V.O.): Last week, on Seinfeld.
(A selection of scenes from The Cadillac (1) establish the story so far.)
[Morty and Helen's, Florida]
(Jerry is trying, unsuccessfully, to sleep on the infamous fold-out. He twists and turns, but can't find a comfortable position.)
JERRY (V.O.): Ow. Stupid fold-out! Why'd they put the bar in the middle of the bed?
(Jerry continues to thrash about in discomfort. The phone rings and Jerry picks it up.)
JERRY: Hello?
(On the other end of the line is Elaine, in bed back in New York.)
ELAINE: (flirtatious) Hi Jerry.
JERRY: Elaine? Wh..what's going on?
(Elaine rests on one elbow, playing with her hair as she chats playfully with Jerry.)
ELAINE: (clears throat) I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little.
JERRY: (a little confused) You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables?
(Elaine gives a slightly overdone girly giggle-laugh at Jerry's comment.)
ELAINE: Well, it's just two hours by plane...
JERRY: Gee, I dunno what to tell you.
(There is a beep from Elaine's phone.)
ELAINE: Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry.
(Elaine hits a button on her phone to take the other call.)
ELAINE: Yeah?
(The other call is George. He sits on his couch in his dressing gown.)
GEORGE: (urgent whisper) Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number!
ELAINE: (impatient) Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number.
(George punches the air in triumph, and sits back on the couch.)
GEORGE: Yeahhh.
ELAINE: Goodbye.
(Elaine hits the button on her phone again, to reconnect with Jerry.)
ELAINE: (smiling and flirty) Hi.
JERRY: Hi.
ELAINE: So, what d'you think?
JERRY: Uh, I don't think so.
ELAINE: (disappointed) Oh.
JERRY: I'll be back on Monday.
ELAINE: Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. (little laugh) Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Alright, I'll see you.
(Jerry is moving to put down the phone when Elaine speaks.)
ELAINE: (urgent) Jerry? Jerry?
JERRY: (putting the phone back to his ear) Yeah.
ELAINE: (breathy) Bye.
JERRY: Bye.
(Jerry puts down the phone, still a little bemused by Elaine.)
[Kramer's Apartment]
(The phone rings and Kramer picks up.)
KRAMER: Hello.
(Somewhere outside, a guy in overalls and a safety helmet is on the phone. He's writing on a clipboard as he speaks to Kramer.)
JOHN: Hello, Mister Kramer? This is John Hanaran, from Con Ed.
(Kramer gets a smile on his face, thinking it's another of the cable guy's tricks.)
KRAMER: Ohh, it's Hanaran now, is it?
JOHN (V.O.): Yeah. We've had some reports of power surges in your building. It seems some jokers were up on the roof, and they must've damaged some of the wires.
KRAMER: Oh, you don't say.
(Kramer walks to his window as he listens.)
JOHN: (a little confused by Kramer) Yeah. Either way, we need to get into your apartment and do a safety check.
(Kramer opens his blinds slightly, as he did before. But there is no cable guy in the phone box across the street, only a woman talking on the phone.)
KRAMER: (impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are really good.
JOHN: (confused) What're you talking about?
(Kramer hits a button to end the call, and puts the phone back on the table. John, the power guy, stares at his phone in disbelief.)
[Monk's]
(Elaine sits in a booth. George enters, looking unnaturally happy, and comes over.)
GEORGE: Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei! (sitting opposite Elaine) And I wasn't even that nervous.
(Elaine watches George, as he rambles on.)
GEORGE: You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm...
ELAINE: (looking at her watch) Okay, well that's all the time we have for today. Why don't we pick up with this next week?
(Elaine rises.)
GEORGE: Hey, where you going?
ELAINE: I got stuff to do.
GEORGE: What? You can't leave yet.
ELAINE: Why not?
GEORGE: We have to discuss my alibi.
ELAINE: Alibi? What does that have to do with me?
GEORGE: I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida.
ELAINE: Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?
GEORGE: Yes.
ELAINE: (pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.
(Elaine sets off to leave, but is stopped by George.)
GEORGE: Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?
ELAINE: What is the difference?
GEORGE: Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync. Hmm?
(Reluctantly, Elaine sits back down with a sigh, as George furrows his brow in concentration.)
GEORGE: Okay. Now, why do I have to see (points) you?
(George and Elaine both think hard for a moment. Then Elaine gets a flash of inspiration.)
ELAINE: Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me.
(Elaine smiles and makes a 'voila' gesture.)
GEORGE: (dismissive) It's no good.
(Elaine looks offended.)
ELAINE: (pointedly) Okay. Fine.
GEORGE: What?
ELAINE: I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.
GEORGE: Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process.
ELAINE: I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful.
GEORGE: (explaining, with lots of hand gestures) Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about.
ELAINE: (weary) Okay.
GEORGE: Alright?
ELAINE: Okay.
GEORGE: Okay.
ELAINE: Fine.
GEORGE: Good.
ELAINE: Fine, fine, fine.
(The twosome go back to thinking for a while. This time George gets the inspiration.)
GEORGE: Okay. How about this?
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: (pleased with himself) You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation.
ELAINE: I don't have a boyfriend.
GEORGE: (still pleased) She doesn't know that. We say that you do.
ELAINE: (not convinced) Ech.
GEORGE: It's good. Believe me.
ELAINE: I thought my idea was just as good.
GEORGE: The dentist thing?
ELAINE: (pointed) Yeah, right. The dentist thing.
GEORGE: Alright, the dentist thing was not good.
ELAINE: Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?
GEORGE: (after a moment's thought) Art Vandelay.
ELAINE: (incredulity) Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend?
GEORGE: That's your boyfriend.
ELAINE: What does he do?
GEORGE: He's an importer.
ELAINE: Just imports? No exports?
GEORGE: (getting irritated) He's an importer-exporter. Okay?
ELAINE: Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?
GEORGE: (thoughtful) Yes. Yes.
ELAINE: (sighs) Yi-yi-yi.
(Elaine and George go into another bout of deep thought.)
ELAINE: Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?
(Elaine finishes with an expectant smile. George looks skeptical, and Elaine seems offended again.)
ELAINE: (irked) Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?
GEORGE: It's very complicated.
ELAINE: (definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?
(George avoids Elaine's gaze, looking down.)
[Morty and Helen's, Florida]
(Helen is in the kitchen, putting cookies on a plate, as a restless Morty fusses around.)
MORTY: What're you doing? Are you making coffee?
HELEN: Yeah.
MORTY: Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too.
HELEN: Morty, you're driving me crazy.
MORTY: Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach me, I'll be a laughing stock.
HELEN: You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences.
(The doorbell chimes.)
MORTY: There she is.
(Morty and Helen both go to the door. Morty opens it and Mrs Choate enters.)
MORTY: Hello. Hello, Mrs Choate.
HELEN: Oh, come in, come in. May I take your coat.
MRS. CHOATE: No, no. I prefer to wear it. Nobody's taking my coat.
HELEN: Ah, how 'bout a cup of coffee or something?
MRS. CHOATE: Coffee? Ach. I'll take hot water with lemon, if you have it.
HELEN: I'll see. (indicating the couch) Have a seat. That's a lovely scarf you're wearing. Where did you get it?
(Helen goes to the kitchen as Mrs Choate sits on the couch.)
MRS. CHOATE: Ahh, they're a dime a dozen.
(Jerry enters.)
HELEN: Oh, hi Jerry. Mrs Choate, (indicating) this is my son, Jerry.
(Mrs Choate turns to look at Jerry. Jerry looks astonished as he recognises Mrs Choate. He remembers an incident from "The Rye".)
[New York Street, "The Rye"]
(Jerry grapples with Mrs Choate, for possession of a bag.
JERRY: Gimme that rye!)
MRS. CHOATE: Stop it. Let go. Help! Someone, help!
(Jerry wrests the bag from the old lady's grip.)
JERRY: Shut up, you old bag!
(Jerry races away down the street with the rye.)
MRS. CHOATE: (shouting after him) Thief! Stop him! Stop him, he's got my rye!
[Morty and Helen's, Florida]
(Jerry manages to regain a normal expression.)
JERRY: Nice to meet you.
MRS. CHOATE: Hello.
MORTY: (holding Jerry's shoulders) Jerry lives in New York. You just came from New York, didn't you?
(Jerry looks desperate. The last thing he needs is Mrs Choate connecting him with New York.)
MRS. CHOATE: Yeah. I was visiting my daughter, and I'll never go back. The crime there is just terrible. Do you know I got mugged for a marble rye, right on the street?
(Jerry gives a look of sympathy. Helen brings a couple of saucers and cups from the kitchen, placing them on the table before Mrs Choate.)
HELEN: (sympathy) Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye? Why would they steal a rye?
MORTY: That's what the city's turning into. They'll steal anything.
MRS. CHOATE: They're like savages.
JERRY: Yeah, there's some sickos out there.
MRS. CHOATE: (peering at Jerry) You look very familiar. Have we ever met?
JERRY: You ever go to Camp Tiyoga?
HELEN: Maybe you've seen him on television.
MORTY: Jerry's a comedian.
MRS. CHOATE: Naw, I don't watch TV.
(Jerry has moved rapidly to the door.)
JERRY: (opening the door) Well, it was nice meeting you.
MORTY: Jerry, don't go.
JERRY: Ah, I think I'll go.
(Jerry darts out and shuts the door behind him.)
MRS. CHOATE: So, Morty, what's this all about? What d'you want?
[George's Apartment]
(Susan sits on the couch, reading. She spots George, in his coat, heading for the door.)
SUSAN: Hey, where're you going?
GEORGE: Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.
SUSAN: Elaine? What for?
GEORGE: I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.
SUSAN: I didn't even know she was dating anyone.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.
SUSAN: So what does he do?
GEORGE: He's an importer-exporter.
SUSAN: What kind of problems are they having?
GEORGE: (not happy delivering Elaine's lie) Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.
(Susan looks unconvinced.)
SUSAN: Are you having an affair with Elaine?
GEORGE: (trying to laugh it off) Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.
SUSAN: Huh?
(George gives a smile and slides out the door.)
[Street]
(Kramer strolls along the street, carrying a big bag of groceries. He becomes aware that a vehicle is slowly driving along the road just behind him. Kramer shifts his load of groceries, so that a shiny baking tray is in a position he can use it as a mirror. Behind him, he can see the blurry image of a Plaza Cable truck. Kramer begins to walk faster, then breaks into a run.)
[Another Street]
(Kramer slows from his run, and looks behind himself. A smile comes to his face, as he sees the truck is no longer there. He allows himself a little shrug of satisfaction at having beaten the cable guy. Kramer turns and begins to walk on, with his groceries, when there is a screech of tyres and the cable truck comes to a halt in front of him - having taken another route to head him off.)
(The cable guy gives a 'come here' gesture with his forefinger through the truck window. Kramer turns and sets off running. He runs into a litter bin, drops his groceries and falls to the floor. The cable guy climbs from his truck and begins to advance on Kramer. Kramer picks himself up and, abandoning his groceries, sets off running again, with the cable guy in pursuit.)
[Variety of New York locations]
(Kramer runs across a busy thoroughfare, followed, seconds later, by the cable guy.)
(Kramer hauls himself over a wall in a park, looks around, and then sets off running. Moments later, the cable guy struggles over the same wall and sets off after Kramer.)
(Kramer runs across an expanse of grass in the park, with the cable guy just a few yards behind.)
(Kramer runs across a New York rooftop. He comes to the edge of the roof and looks for a way across to the next building. Kramer looks worriedly behind him, for the pursuing cable guy, then down into the gap between buildings. Despite his worry at the height, he steps back a few paces, takes a run-up, and leaps across to land on the roof of the next building. Kramer picks himself up and sets off running again. Behind him, the cable guy comes to the same gap, looks down at how far he has to fall, and thinks better of attempting the leap.)
NICK: (yelling after the fleeing Kramer) I'll get you! I'll get you Kramer! You won't get away with this!
[Morty and Helen's, Florida]
(Morty is fastening a jacket as he enters.)
MORTY: Alright, are you ready to eat?
HELEN: (glancing at her watch) Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go, it's time to eat. We're going to dinner.
(Jerry wanders into the room. He's in a t-shirt and sweatpants, and holding a comic book he's been reading.)
JERRY: (confused) Dinner? W..What time is it?
HELEN: (pulling on a coat) It's four-thirty.
JERRY: (bewildered) Four-thirty? Who eats dinner at four-thirty?
MORTY: By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five.
JERRY: I don't understand why we have to eat now.
HELEN: We gotta catch the early-bird. It's only between four-thirty and six.
MORTY: Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for four-ninety-five. You know what that cost you after six?
JERRY: Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?
HELEN: You're not buying us dinner.
JERRY: (emphatic) I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!
HELEN: Alright, (sitting on the couch) we'll wait. (pointedly) But it's unheard of.
(Jerry shakes his head, incredulous, and wanders away with his comic book.)
[Park]
(George sits on a bench with Marisa Tomei. He's mid-speech, and Marisa's looking interested, smiling and laughing.)
GEORGE: ...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right?
MARISA: (laughing) You're so right. I never thought of it like that. Manure. 'Ma' and the 'newer'.
(Marisa laughs and George is smiling happily.)
MARISA: Did you just make that up?
GEORGE: What, you think I'm doing material here?
MARISA: (laughs) No, no. It's hard to believe anyone could be so spontaneously funny.
GEORGE: (modest) And I'm a little tired.
(Marisa laughs again, then speaks, still smiling, but more seriously.)
MARISA: So, tell me, how is it that a man like you, so bald, and so quirky and funny, how is it you're not taken?
GEORGE: Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.
(Marisa's face falls in disappointment.)
MARISA: What?
GEORGE: I'm, you know, engaged.
(Marisa's expression turns to anger. She swings a fist and punches George in the face, then grabs her bag and storms away. George feels the painful spot where he received the blow.)
[Outside Scott's, Florida]
(A few people stand around outside. The Seinfeld's Cadillac drives up to the front of the restaurant. There's a gap in the parked cars, right by the entrance.)
JERRY (V.O): Hey look, there's a spot right in front.
MORTY(V.O.): Always, Jerry. Always.
(The Cadillac pulls into the space. From the entrance of Scott's emerge Jack and Doris Klompus, Jack using a toothpick)
DORIS: Was that delicious or what?
JACK: Where you gonna get a better meal than that?
DORIS: Better than Danny's.
JACK: Danny's? (scoffs) C'mon!
(The Seinfelds walk toward the entrance, where they meet the Klompus duo.)
MORTY: Hello Jack.
HELEN: Doris.
DORIS: Hello, hello.
JERRY: Jack.
DORIS: Hello, Jerry.
JERRY: Hi Doris.
JACK: Hello Morty. (looking at watch) Well, missed the early bird.
MORTY: Yeah, so?
JACK: (pointed) Must be nice to have that kind of money.
(Jack calls over to one of the people outside the restaurant.)
JACK: Bernie, look who's eating at six o'clock. (pointed) Your suddenly well-to-do president. But, you enjoy your last meal in office. Tomorrow, they kick you out, you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac.
(Morty is looking confident, even smug.)
MORTY: They're not kicking me out. You don't have the votes.
JACK: That's what you think.
MORTY: We'll see.
JACK: Yes, we will.
JERRY: Awright, let's eat already.
(The Seinfelds enter Scott's, and Jack and Doris walk past the Cadillac.)
[Elaine's Apartment]
(Elaine answers a knock at the door, to find a slightly anxious looking Susan.)
ELAINE: Hi, Susan.
SUSAN: Hi.
ELAINE: Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.
(Susan walks in, and crosses to the couch. Elaine closes the door.)
SUSAN: (standing) Uh, Elaine, I have to ask you a question.
ELAINE: Oh, sure.
SUSAN: (dead serious) Are you having an affair with George?
ELAINE: (disbelief) Wha...?! (uncontrolled laughter) Ha ha ha. Ha, no.
(Elaine has to sit on the arm of a chair, she's laughing so hard.)
ELAINE: (laughter) Don't be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep...
(Elaine realises who she's speaking to, and the laughter dies away.)
ELAINE: ...Well, obviously... You know... (disbelief) Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George?
SUSAN: Ohh, because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some problem that you were having.
ELAINE: (recalling the arranged lie) Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend.
SUSAN: Art Vandelay?
ELAINE: Yeah, Art Vandelay.
SUSAN: I'm sorry. (laughing it off) I feel like an idiot.
ELAINE: (smiling) No, no. (laughing) Huh-hu-hu. It's okay.
SUSAN: Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay?
ELAINE: It is so forgotten.
SUSAN: Alright.
(Susan moves toward the door.)
ELAINE: Okay. (relieved) Okay, no problem.
(Susan has the door open, when a thought occurs to her.)
SUSAN: So, was George helpful at all?
ELAINE: (unconvincing) Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. (hesitant) Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.
SUSAN: (not convinced) Yeah.
ELAINE: (explaining, with gestures) Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing.
SUSAN: (spotting an inconsistency) Wait a minute. I thought that Art wanted to give up the exporting.
ELAINE: What'd I say?
SUSAN: The importing.
ELAINE: (caught out) I did. Uh...
SUSAN: So, what does he uh, import?
ELAINE: (extemporising) Uh... chips.
SUSAN: Oh. What kinda chips?
ELAINE: Potato.
SUSAN: Ah.
ELAINE: (embroidering) Some corn.
SUSAN: And what does he export?
ELAINE: Diapers.
SUSAN: (fake smile) I'm sorry for bothering you.
ELAINE: Oh, no, it's okay.
(Susan and Elaine both use fake laughs, as Susan leaves and closes the door.)
ELAINE: Okay.
(The moment the door closes behind Susan, Elaine races to her phone and dials a number hurriedly. She stands, listening to the ring, desperate for a response.)
ELAINE: (to herself) C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.
[George's Apartment]
(Susan stands sifting through some magazines, when the door opens and George enters. He's still feeling his face where Marisa punched him. )
GEORGE: Hi.
SUSAN: Hi. (pointedly) So, George, what does Art Vandelay import?
(George looks surprised by the question, and thinks for a moment before replying.)
GEORGE: Matches? Long matches.
(Susan raises her arm, and delivers the second punch that George has received today. George is thrown backwards out of the door by the blow, and Susan slams the door behind him.)
[Tenant's Committee, Florida]
(Around the table are the board of phase two. Morty and Jack sit beside each other. Herb is chairing the meeting, and several other representatives are present, some chatting with each other. Herb spots Mrs Choate coming in through the door.)
HERB: ...There she is. Okay, if I can have your attention for a minute here. We're calling this emergency meeting of the board of phase two, to consider a motion of impeachment of our president, (indicating) Morty Seinfeld.
(Mrs Choate sits beside Morty. )
MORTY: Nervous, Jack?
JACK: What for?
MORTY: Because I have the votes.
Morty turns to Mrs Choate.
MORTY: Nice to see you, Mrs Choate.
MRS. CHOATE: Hello, Morty.
(Jack looks surprised at the friendliness between Morty and Mrs Choate.)
HERB: Building A. Are you for, or against, the motion to impeach?
RALPH: What does that mean?
HERB: It means, if you're for the motion, you're against Morty.
RALPH: So why don't you say that?
HERB: Hey, I'm running the meeting.
RALPH: If you think so.
HERB: Building A?
BUILDING A: For impeachment.
HERB: Building B?
BUILDING B: Against impeachment.
HERB: Building C?
BUILDING C: For impeachment.
HERB: Building D?
MRS. CHOATE: Against impeachment.
JACK: (a whisper to Morty) I can't believe you got that old bag.
(Mrs Choate overhears Jack's comment, and it stirs a memory. She thinks back.)
[New York Street, "The Rye"]
(Jerry and Mrs Choate struggle for possession of a bag containing a marble rye. )
MRS. CHOATE: Help! Someone help!
JERRY: Shut up, you old bag!
(Jerry wrests the bag from Mrs Choate and takes off down the street. )
MRS. CHOATE: (after Jerry) Oh, thief! Thief!
[Tenant's Committee, Florida]
(Mrs Choate wears a look of shocked realisation. She stands and addresses Morty. )
MRS. CHOATE: It's him. (pointing at Morty) It's your son. Now I know where I saw him. He stole my marble rye.
MORTY: My son never stole anything. He's a good boy.
RALPH: They should lock him up.
MRS. CHOATE: (pointing at Morty) Like father, like son. (thumps table) I change my vote. I vote to impeach!
BUILDING B: Me too. I change my vote.
HERB: All those in favour, say aye.
ALL (EXCEPT MORTY): Aye.
HERB: All opposed.
(Morty forlornly raises his hand. )
HERB: The ayes have it. The motion passes.
(Jack smiles a big smug smile of triumph, aimed at Morty.)
HERB: Morty Seinfeld, you are officially dismissed as condo president. As vice-president, Jack Klompus, in accordance with the phase two constitution, is hereby installed as president.
(Jack stands to acknowledge the honour. )
HERB: Hear, hear, Jack.
(Jack raises a hand in salute, as the rest of the board applaud him. A disgruntled Morty remains silent. )
[Hall Outside Jerry's Apartment]
(A weary looking Nick, the cable guy, leans against Kramer's door. He knocks and there's no response. )
NICK: (weary) Alright, I know you're in there. I know you can hear me. You win, okay? You win. I can't do it any more. What d'you want from me? Apology? Alright, I'm sorry. There, I said it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I see now how we made you feel when we made you sit home waiting. I dunno why we do it. (upset) I guess maybe we just kind of enjoy taking advantage of people. (reasonable) Well, that's gonna change. From now on, no more 'nine to twelve', no more 'one to five'. We're gonna have appointments. Eleven o'clock is gonna mean eleven o'clock. And, if we can't make it, we're gonna call you, tell you why. (worked up) For god's sakes, if a doctor can do it, why can't we? (almost sobbing) Anyway, that's it.
(The cable guy sighs, and begins to walk away. Kramer's door opens, and Kramer emerges. He and Nick look at each other apologetically for a few seconds. Then Kramer steps forward and they hug. )
[Morty and Helen's, Florida]
(Morty comes in from the bedroom, looking around at his home. Helen holds his coat as he slips into it. She adjusts his collar and hands him a blue hat. Jerry enters through the front door. )
JERRY: The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.
(Jerry leads the way, followed by Helen, who folds a coat over her arm. Morty waits a second or two, having a final look round the room. He stands by the door, then steels himself. Giving a determined nod, he exits, closing the door behind him.)
[Outside Morty and Helen's, Florida]
(The Seinfelds walk, three abreast, toward the Cadillac. As they walk, they pass the other residents, who have come to see them off. They nod acknowledgement. As they get to the car, Helen and Jerry get in, but Morty stands in the open door of the Cadillac, turns to the assembled throng and gives a big smile, and arms-wide gesture (like Nixon leaving the White House), before climbing into the car. The residents wave back, one or two of them in tears, and Morty slowly drives the Cadillac away.)
[Elaine in a doctor's office.]
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals.
DOCTOR: I'll need a urine sample.
ELAINE: Right.
[George, Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.]
GEORGE: You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils.
ELAINE: Oh, Come on.
JERRY: Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?
GEORGE: Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok?
JERRY: Yeah, sure. My parents will be there.
ELAINE: The Tonight Show?
JERRY: Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?
ELAINE: Are you doing new material?
JERRY: No.
ELAINE: I don't think so.
(Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they changed your shower head?
JERRY: No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.
KRAMER: Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.
(Kramer exits.)
ELAINE: So what are your parents doing here in new York?
JERRY: Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.
ELAINE: So what are their plans?
JERRY: Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.
ELAINE: You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?
JERRY: No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.
GEORGE: Uncle Leo's having regular sex?
JERRY: Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.
JERRY: (answering phone) Hello?
MORTY: Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday.
JERRY: You gotta be there at 4:30.
MORTY: But it comes on 11:30.
JERRY: Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 11:30.
MORTY: How long they been doing this?
JERRY: 30 years.
MORTY: Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?
JERRY: All right, I'll see you later.
ELAINE: Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?
GEORGE: Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?
JERRY: Yeah, it is.
GEORGE: I mean, they're retired.
JERRY: No economic reason for them to be here.
GEORGE: They have no friends.
JERRY: No social reason for them to be here.
ELAINE: You're all grown up.
GEORGE: Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back to you.
(George exits with the Del Boca Vista pamphlet.)
JERRY (answering phone again) Hello?
HELEN: Where can I buy some ice? Your father likes a lot of ice.
JERRY: I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?
HELEN: I can do that.
JERRY: You know Dad just called me.
HELEN: Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up.
JERRY: Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.
HELEN: Ok.
JERRY: All right, bye. (to Elaine): You see this? Any thought pops into their head they're calling me because it's a local call now.
ELAINE: Ahh.
JERRY: I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!
ELAINE: They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?
JERRY: The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.
ELAINE: How's that gonna happen?
[Jerry and Uncle Leo at Monk's coffee shop.]
UNCLE LEO: It's about time you called your uncle. We've got to do this once a week.
JERRY: (to himself) Once a week? (to Uncle Leo) So how's Lydia?
UNCLE LEO: Ah, she's a real tiger.
JERRY: I don't know how you do it.
UNCLE LEO: What?
JERRY: A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business.
UNCLE LEO: What are you talking about?
JERRY: Well...
UNCLE LEO: Look at this, I told them medium rare, it's medium.
JERRY: Hey, it happens.
UNCLE LEO: I bet that cook is an anti-Semite.
JERRY: He has no idea who you are.
UNCLE LEO: They don't just overcook a hamburger, Jerry.
JERRY: All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, "It's been real," move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.
UNCLE LEO: Believe me, I thought about it. But she is so perfect in every way, I can't see a flaw.
JERRY: Well, keep looking.
[Elaine and Mr. Peterman at work.]
PETERMAN: I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be accompanying me to Africa.
ELAINE: What? Why not?
PETERMAN: I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium.
ELAINE: Opium?
PETERMAN: That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally.
ELAINE: Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake.
PETERMAN: Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict, Elaine.
ELAINE: Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.
PETERMAN: All right, Elaine.
ELAINE: Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) I'll be ready in three minutes.
[George and his parents at their home in Queens.]
GEORGE: Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh. Bitter cold, bitter.
FRANK: I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities.
ESTELLE: What extremities?
GEORGE: You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three.
ESTELLE: So George, why are you here?
GEORGE: What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet on coffee table)
ESTELLE: What's this.
GEORGE: That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up.
ESTELLE: I don't bet.
GEORGE: What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.
ESTELLE: I don't swim.
GEORGE: You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the sidewalks.
ESTELLE: Are you trying to get rid of us?
GEORGE: Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away.
[Elaine, back in the doctor's office. The doctor is consulting a chart and shaking his head no.]
ELAINE: No?
(The doctor hands Elaine the chart, she looks at it in astonishment.)
[Jerry's apartment. Kramer walks in, his trademark 'high hair' is flat.]
KRAMER: Jerry? Jerry!
(Jerry walks in from the back room, his hair is also flat.)
KRAMER: Wha, you too?
JERRY: Yeah!
KRAMER: These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the shampoo out of my hair.
JERRY: Me either.
KRAMER: If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.
JERRY: You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.
KRAMER: (leaving) Aw.
JERRY: Where are you going?
KRAMER: I gotta find another shower.
[Hallway outside Newman's apartment. Kramer knocks on Newman's door. Newman answers, with flat hair.]
KRAMER: They got you too?
NEWMAN: This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman!
(Kramer backs away then runs down the hall.)
[Elaine's office, Kramer rushes in.]
KRAMER: Oh, Elaine. Yeah.
ELAINE: Kramer, you look terrible.
KRAMER: Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower.
ELAINE: What's wrong with your shower?
KRAMER: There's no water pressure.
ELAINE: Why don't you just go see Jerry?
(Just as Kramer is about to answer, Mr. Peterman walks past Elaine's open office door and pauses.)
KRAMER: Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out.
PETERMAN: (busting in) Not on my watch! (Grabs Kramer by the collar) I won't have you turning my office into a den of iniquity! Get your fix somewhere else!
(Throws Kramer out and slams the door closed)
ELAINE: Mr Peterman! What are you doing?
PETERMAN: Elaine, you're out of control. You need help.
ELAINE: Huh?
PETERMAN: I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of opium. It was 1979. I was travelling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown, all of the clothing traders had gone, but a different sort of trader still lurked about. "Just a taste," he said. That was all it took.
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything.
PETERMAN: Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one. The price? Your soul. Oh, and by the way, you have til' 5:00 to clear out your desk. You're fired.
[Jerry's dressing room at NBC. Jerry and his parents are there.]
HELEN: All they serve is chicken?
JERRY: There's more food down the hall.
MORTY: Wrap it up, we'll take it home.
(George walks in with his parents.)
JERRY: Oh, hi.
ESTELLE: Hello Seinfelds.
MORTY: Hello.
HELEN: Hi.
FRANK: This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini.
ESTELLE: Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you.
JERRY: Actually, I'm drunk.
GEORGE: Hey, hey, how was Florida?
MORTY: Well, we just bought a new place down there.
ESTELLE: I know, we were looking at the brochure.
MORTY: What?
HELEN: Why, you thinking of moving?
FRANK: Not really.
MORTY: Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that development.
FRANK: Are you telling me there's not one condo available in all of Del Boca Vista?
MORTY: That's right. They went like hotcakes.
FRANK: How'd you get yours?
MORTY: Got lucky.
FRANK: Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!
JERRY: I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.
[Monk's coffee shop, Elaine is at the counter eating a muffin and talking with a waitress.]
ELAINE: How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?
WAITRESS: Yeah, it's hard to figure.
ELAINE: I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari.
WAITRESS: Ah, the bush-men?
ELAINE: And the bush-women.
MAN: (also seated at the counter) Excuse me. I couldn't help overhearing. I notice you're eating a poppy seed muffin.
ELAINE: Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time.
MAN: Well, you know what opium is made from...
ELAINE: (as though receiving a revelation) Poppies!
[Jerry is on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno.]
JAY LENO: Welcome back. Talking with Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry, lemme ask you, I saw some people back there, they look like.. family? Is that family?
JERRY: Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia, watching Jerry on TV. Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.
[Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone.]
JERRY: Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
(Kramer walks in wearing a bathrobe, his hair is still flat.)
JERRY: Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?
KRAMER: (halfheartedly) Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya.
JERRY: Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?
KRAMER: I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?
JERRY: No good?
KRAMER: It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.
JERRY: Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?
KRAMER: Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.
JERRY: (offering a plate) Chicken?
KRAMER: Oh, yeah.
(Elaine enters.)
ELAINE: Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!
JERRY: Poppy seeds!
KRAMER: Well, that makes sense. (Offers plate to Elaine) Want some chicken?
ELAINE: Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa.
(There's a knock at the door, Jerry answers it, it's Newman.)
JERRY: Hello Newman.
NEWMAN: Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us?
ELAINE: Oh c'mon, Newman.
NEWMAN: I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. (Opens door) If you don't mind?
ELAINE: Jerry?
NEWMAN: Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it! (Pushes Elaine out the door and closes it) All right, now here's the lowdown. From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers.
JERRY: Not from the footage I've seen.
NEWMAN: Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?
KRAMER: I'm down.
NEWMAN: Jerry?
(Jerry nods reluctantly.)
[Frank and Estelle's house.]
ESTELLE: So, Georgie, we have some big news for you.
GEORGE: Big news?
ESTELLE: We're moving to Florida.
GEORGE: (ecstatic) What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm so happy! (pause) For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this cold weather for?
FRANK: Has nothing to do with the weather, it's because of the Seinfelds.
GEORGE: What do you mean?
FRANK: They don't want us there, so we're going. We're moving right into Del Boca Vista!
GEORGE: So you're moving there for spite!
FRANK: Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do!
GEORGE: That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!
ESTELLE: So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?
GEORGE: Oh, every chance I get.
ESTELLE: (warmly) Ohhh.
[George busts into Jerry's apartment.]
GEORGE: Jerry? Jerry! I'm busting! I'm busting!
JERRY: What's going on?
GEORGE: My parents are moving to Florida!
JERRY: Are you kidding?
GEORGE: Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm free!!
JERRY: Where are they moving to?
GEORGE: Del Boca Vista!
JERRY: Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!
GEORGE: I know!
JERRY: We could visit together!
GEORGE: Every five years!
(They 'high five' each other.)
JERRY: That's incredible!
GEORGE: I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?
JERRY: Why?
GEORGE: To spite your parents!
JERRY: To spite my parents?
GEORGE: Yeah!
JERRY: Your parents are crazy!
GEORGE: I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!
JERRY: My parents are moving back too!
GEORGE: Beautiful!
[Helen and Morty, packing up in Uncle Leo's apartment.]
MORTY: I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida.
HELEN: He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened?
(Morty shrugs, the phone rings, Morty answers.)
MORTY: Hello?
VOICE: This is Frank Costanza.
MORTY: What do you want?
FRANK: You think you could keep us out of Florida? We're moving in lock, stock and barrel. We're gonna be in the pool. We're gonna be in the clubhouse. We're gonna be all over that shuffleboard court! And I dare you to keep me out!
(Frank hangs up, Morty hangs up.)
MORTY: I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida.
[Jerry's apartment, Jerry and George are toasting their good fortune.]
GEORGE: I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.
JERRY: You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.
(The phone rings, Jerry answers.)
JERRY: Hello.
MORTY: Hello, Jerry? It's your father.
JERRY: Oh, hi dad.
MORTY: Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle.
MORTY: What was that?
JERRY: Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?
MORTY: Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.
JERRY: But it's a big complex.
MORTY: You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone.
JERRY: All right, fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone)
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.
GEORGE: What? Why?
JERRY: Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.
GEORGE: Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn to live, baby.
JERRY: You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake.
[Monk's coffee shop, Jerry and Uncle Leo are sharing a booth.]
UNCLE LEO: Move back with Lydia?
JERRY: C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody.
UNCLE LEO: Last week you told me I was in my prime, I should be swinging.
JERRY: Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.
UNCLE LEO: But she's an anti-Semite.
JERRY: Can you blame her?
[Helen and Morty are unpacking in Jerry's apartment.]
HELEN: You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?
MORTY: Why would he mind? We're his parents.
(Elaine walks in picking her teeth, she didn't expect to see Jerry's parents.)
ELAINE: Oh.
HELEN: Hi Elaine.
ELAINE: Hello. Jerry's not here?
HELEN: No.
ELAINE: Huh. (pause) Oh my god.
HELEN: What?
ELAINE: A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour.
HELEN: Why?
ELAINE: It's a long story.
HELEN: Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom.
ELAINE: What are you gonna do in there?
HELEN: What am I gonna do in the bathroom?
ELAINE: You gotta do me a favor.
HELEN: Elaine, I really--
ELAINE: Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.
HELEN: You want my urine?
ELAINE: I need a clean urine sample from a woman.
HELEN: I don't know.
ELAINE: Oh please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?
HELEN: Well, what am I gonna do it in?
ELAINE: Well, one of those glasses.
HELEN: Jerry's glasses?
ELAINE: Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom.
HELEN: Oh, I could uh-- Should I use a coffee cup?
ELAINE: Yeah, a coffee cup's fine.
HELEN: Or maybe a juice glass.
ELAINE: Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect.
HELEN: This one is kind of scratched.
ELAINE: It doesn't matter.
HELEN: Howbout A milk glass.
ELAINE: A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass.
HELEN: Jerry doesn't wash these very well.
ELAINE: Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!
[Kramer, Newman and a 'salesman' are at the back of a van in an alley.]
SALESMAN: All right, I got everything here. I got the Cyclone F series, Hydra Jet Flow, Stockholm Superstream, you name it.
JERRY: What do you recommend?
SALESMAN: What are you looking for?
KRAMER: Power, man. Power.
NEWMAN: Like Silkwood.
KRAMER: That's for radiation.
NEWMAN: That's right.
KRAMER: (pointing to the largest one) Now, what is this?
SALESMAN: That's the Commando 450, I don't sell that one. What about thi-
KRAMER: Well that's what we want, the Commando 450.
SALESMAN: Nah, believe me. It's only used in the circus. For elephants.
NEWMAN: We'll pay anything. We've got the (hands a wad of money to Kramer) What about Jerry?
KRAMER: He couldn't handle that, he's delicate.
[Helen and Morty are unpacking in Uncle Leo's apartment.]
HELEN: It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.
MORTY: First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on?
(There's a knock at the door.)
MORTY: Who is it?
SUPER: It's the super. We're installing new low-flow showerheads in all the bathrooms.
MORTY: Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.
[Mr. Peterman, in his office, on the telephone.]
PETERMAN: So as a result of your test being free of opium, I am reinstating you.
ELAINE: Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?
PETERMAN: I'm afraid I can't take you.
ELAINE: What? Why not?
PETERMAN: Elaine, according to your urine analysis, you're menopausal. you have the metabolism of a sixty-eight year old woman.
ELAINE: But I wanted to see the bushmen.
PETERMAN: Oh, and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis.
[Jerry is seeing his parents off as the cab driver loads their bags. They have flat hair.]
JERRY: Well, it's been a great visit.
MORTY: Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to Florida is take a shower.
JERRY: Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George.
HELEN: George must be happy about that.
JERRY: You have no idea.
[George's parents' house, George is sitting on the couch between Frank and Estelle, he's obviously disappointed.]
FRANK: Take my swim trunks. I won't need them.
ESTELLE: What does he want with your swim trunks?
FRANK: Why should they go to waste?!?
[Kramer, in the shower]
(He's got the Commando 450 shower head hooked up. He turns it on, the water shoots out full blast and knocks him backwards. He grabs the shower curtain for support and tries to reach forward to turn the faucet off, but the force of the water is too great, he only succeeds in knocking over a few shampoo bottles. Kramer is eventually pushed back enough by the water to become entangled in the shower curtain until he eventually falls out of the shower, and out of camera range.)
[Setting: Night club]
(Jerry is just now getting done with his act)
JERRY: Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)
SALLY: Jerry!
JERRY: (Trying to ward her off) Hey. Hey!
SALLY: (Reminding him who she is) Sally Weaver! (Sees Jerry's expression - he still has no clue who she is) Susan Ross' roommate from college.. hello! (Laughs slightly)
JERRY: Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?
SALLY: Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for the free tickets. You are so funny.
JERRY: (Modest) Oh, thanks.
SALLY: (Serious) No, no, I mean it. You're very funny.
JERRY: (Blunt) I believe you.
SALLY: Oh, anyway, let me show you Memphis. I am taking you (Points to him) out to dinner.
JERRY: (Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.
SALLY: Ohh.. that's too bad.. Susan thought we'd really get along - I guess because we're both wacko! (Jerry laughs) You know what, um.. (Turns around, picking up a large gift from a table) You have to give this to them for me. Okay? Here. (Hands the box to Jerry, he struggles under the size of it) It's a wedding present.
JERRY: Oh?
SALLY: And Jerry? Be careful with it, okay? Be very careful.
JERRY: Uh-huh.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: The Coffee shop]
(George and his father, Frank, are sitting at a booth)
FRANK: George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.
GEORGE: (Resenting the fact. Nodding) I am aware.
FRANK: So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor?
GEORGE: A billiard parlor?
FRANK: Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity..
(Elaine enters. George spots her in mid-sentence)
GEORGE: Well, that's.. Elaine!
ELAINE: Oh, hi, Frank.
GEORGE: (Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please.
ELAINE: (Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.
GEORGE: (Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.
ELAINE: (Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?
GEORGE: (Confused) What photo?
ELAINE: You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said "Costanza"?
FRANK: (Interested) There's a Costanza in Tuscany? (Elaine nods) Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?
ELAINE: I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.
FRANK: I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo.
ELAINE: Who is that?
GEORGE: (Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.
FRANK: I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated.
ELAINE: So, you weren't born here?
FRANK: No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote. (Yelling out) They don't want me, I don't want them!
GEORGE: I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-
FRANK: (Cutting him off) Don't bring me down. (To Elaine) Do you have another copy of that photo?
ELAINE: No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.
FRANK: The Maestro? What Maestro?
ELAINE: He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.
GEORGE: Really? Why?
ELAINE: (Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.
GEORGE: Who?
ELAINE: You know the Three Tenors?
GEORGE: Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.
ELAINE: (Nodding) The other guy.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Airplane]
(Jerry's flying to NY. On his lap is Sally's present and his personal bag. He's trying to read a magazine while a stewardess approaches him)
STEWARDESS: (Overly nice) Could I take that box for you?
JERRY: Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.
STEWARDESS: Oh, then, I'll have to put your bag in the over-head.
JERRY: Oh, okay..
(The stewardess takes the bag, and crams it into the over-head compartment. The sound of glass breaking can be heard)
STEWARDESS: There we go.
(Jerry gives a face of pure dissatisfaction)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Kramer enters while Jerry's unpacking. The clothes in his suitcase are covered in bar-b-que sauce)
JERRY: Ohh.. look at this..
KRAMER: What?
JERRY: I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
(Gestures to Sally's present) stupid thing.
KRAMER: Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..
JERRY: I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
KRAMER: (Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see..
JERRY: No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.
KRAMER: Well, why don't you do your material?
JERRY: I'm out.
KRAMER: (Looking up, sighs) Well, you better get to work.
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Thanks for the tip.
(George enters)
GEORGE: Hey, buddies.
JERRY: Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.
GEORGE: Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.
JERRY: (Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing?
KRAMER: (Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? (Eats the bread)
(George is still opening the gift - flinging Styrofoam peanuts all over the table)
JERRY: (Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
KRAMER: (Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?
JERRY: Like what?
KRAMER: Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) "What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"
JERRY: (Confused) Where's the punchline?
KRAMER: It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's)
GOERGE: (Taking out a mat from the huge box) Well, this is certainly a crappy gift..
JERRY: A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!
GEORGE: Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.
JERRY: Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!
KRAMER: Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) "The Costanzas"
GEORGE: No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.
KRAMER: Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.
GEORGE: I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.
KRAMER: (Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..
(Scene ends)
[Setting: George's old bedroom]
(The room is remodeled into a billiard room. The pool table is obviously way too big for the room. Frank and Kramer are chalking up their sticks)
KRAMER: So, what's your game? What do you like to play?
FRANK: Eight ball.
KRAMER: No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm?
FRANK: You like to gamble, Cosmo?
KRAMER: Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..
FRANK: Five dollars a game, huh?
KRAMER: I'll break.
FRANK: Okay.
(Kramer goes to pull back his pool stick, but it is stopped short by the wall. Scene cuts to a montage with multiple scenes involving humorous accounts of their trying to play in such a tiny room)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: George and Susan's apartment]
(Susan has boxes in the living room, and is setting up some of her items around the apartment)
GEORGE: What's all this?
SUSAN: Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff.
GEORGE: (Muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) More stuff..
SUSAN: (Calling out) Oh, I put up my doll collection..
(George walks into his room, and stops in his tracks. Up on the shelves, is a doll that looks exactly like George's mother)
GEORGE: Oh my God! What is that?!
SUSAN: (Rushing in) What? What is it?
GEORGE: (Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother.
SUSAN: George, it's a doll.
GEORGE: I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!
SUSAN: (Going back to the living room) Oh, get outta here..
(Scene ends)
[Setting: George's old bedroom]
(Kramer, holding the pool stick at an awkward angle, is about to hit the ball when Estelle enters)
ESTELLE: What's going on in here? (Kramer hits the cue ball, it jumps up from the table and flies off screen) Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!
FRANK: We still haven't finished the first game.
ESTELLE: The first game?!
KRAMER: (Explaining why they are doing so bad) Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.
FRANK: (To Estelle) he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture..
ESTELLE: Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.
FRANK: (Yelling out) You don't know that! (Estelle leaves, slamming the door) We're gonna go see him, huh?
KRAMER: (Judging up his next move) As soon as the game is over..
FRANK: (Sensing the game is going to last a long time) Oh boy.
KRAMER: Eleven, corner pocket. (Pulls back on his stick, accidentally crashing it into the window)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: George and Susan's bedroom]
(George and Susan are in bed. They go to kiss, but George stops when he sees the doll laying right next to Susan)
GEORGE: What is this thing doing here?
SUSAN: Oh, I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little girl..
(Susan leans in to kiss, but George stops her again)
GEORGE: Uh, I'm sorry, I can't do this..
SUSAN: Why?
GEORGE: I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.
SUSAN: Oh, stop it.
(They kiss. While kissing, George tightly stuffs the doll under Susan's pillow -- out of sight)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry enters the living room from his bathroom with his toothbrush. Elaine is reading the paper at his table)
JERRY: Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.
ELAINE: (Just making conversation) Oh yeah?
JERRY: Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!
ELAINE: (Mock enthusiasm) Oh, that's dynamite.
JERRY: Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?
ELAINE: Who else is on the show?
JERRY: Uh.. one of the three tenors.
ELAINE: (Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?!
JERRY: Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..
ELAINE: (Extremely excited) The other guy?!
JERRY: (Nodding) Yeah, the other guy.
ELAINE: (Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!
JERRY: Why?
ELAINE: Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?
JERRY: Why not?
ELAINE: (Extremely giddy) Wow! The other guy!
(George enters. He's in a disheveled state)
JERRY: Hey, you look awful.
GEORGE: (Sitting on the sofa) I'm on no sleep, bro.
JERRY: Problem in the bedroom?
GEORGE: (Muttering) Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.
(Elaine makes a face)
JERRY: Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?
GEORGE: (Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky. (Takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.
JERRY: I thought you didn't want the doormat.
GEORGE: I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.
JERRY: Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?
GEORGE: Yeah, (Smiling) Susan said you'd be excited.
JERRY: Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!
ELAINE: Who's Sally?
GEORGE: Susan's college roommate.
JERRY: It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
GEORGE: So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.
JERRY: (While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
ELAINE: That's sounds pretty juvenile.
JERRY: (Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! A dinosaur!
(Scene ends)
[Setting: The Maestro's Office]
(Kramer and Frank are in a meeting with the Maestro)
FRANK: His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could recognize him.
MAESTRO: Unfortunately those photographs are at home.
KRAMER: Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.
FRANK: (Trying to concentrate) Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do you call it, Kramer?
KRAMER: A billiard room.
FRANK: No, not billiard.. (Scolding) Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on..
KRAMER: (Confused) What?
FRANK: We call it.. the, uh..
KRAMER: (Snaps) The Place To Be!
FRANK: The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be.
MAESTRO: (Agreeing to a game) Ah, then I shall be there. And now, Gentlemen, (Making dramatic actions) if you will excuse me - I must prepare for the symphony.
KRAMER: Oh, yeah?
(The Maestro gets up. Realizing that he isn't wearing pants, Kramer and Frank stare in bewilderment)
MAESTRO: (Noticing the expressions) Ohh, my pants. (Begins putting on a near-by pair of pants) It's an old conductor's trick I learned from Leonard Bernstein.
KRAMER: Really?
MAESTRO: You keep a perfect crease by not sitting in them before the performance.
(Kramer and Frank are obviously impressed)
KRAMER: That's good thinking.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(George, presenting the doll to Jerry, has his arms out in a 'tada' gesture. Jerry has on a disgusted face)
GEORGE: You see?.. You see?!
JERRY: Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.
GEORGE: Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!
JERRY: Why don't you just get rid of it?
GEORGE: I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing.
JERRY: Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.
(George shoots him a look, then leaves. He is audible as he meets up with Elaine in the hallway)
GEORGE: Hi, Elaine.
(Elaine shrieks out in fright, then enters Jerry's doorway - breathless)
ELAINE: Did you see that?!
JERRY: I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that? (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying)
ELAINE: Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.
JERRY: Oh. (Intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it) Yeah?
SALLY: (Through the intercom) It's Sally.
JERRY: Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?
SALLY: A whole case.
JERRY: (Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?
ELAINE: (Blunt, to the point) No.
JERRY: How come? I told you - It's fantastic.
ELAINE: Eh, I like mine.
JERRY: I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?
ELAINE: I don't want it.
JERRY: (Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.
ELAINE: (Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.
(A knock on the door)
JERRY: Come in.
(Sally enters with a medium-sized box)
SALLY: (Peppy) Well, here I am!
JERRY: Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.
ELAINE: Hi.
JERRY: How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?
SALLY: (Setting the box down on his table) Actually, the seat next to me was empty, so, there was no problem at all.
JERRY: (Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!
SALLY: That's right. It's a special gourmet sauce. "The Pride of Memphis!"
JERRY: (Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!
SALLY: This is much better. And frankly, in Memphis, we think that other sauce as (Whispering) kind of a joke.
JERRY: I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!
SALLY: You could just do your material.
JERRY: (Peeved) I don't have any material!
ELAINE: (Yelling out) He's got nothin'!
(Scene ends)
[Setting: The Coffee Shop]
(George is sitting at the table - opposite the doll. While he eats his meal, he can hear his mother yelling at him via the doll)
DOLL: Georgie! Don't eat with your hands! (George starts eating faster) Why do you eat so fast?! You can't even taste it!
GEORGE: (Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!
(People from near-by tables turn and look at him)
DOLL: You're wearing that shirt? You've had it for five years already! Why don't you get a new shirt?!
GEORGE: (Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny replica) C'mon, let's go. Let's go! (On his way out, he stops in front of a woman blocking his path) Oh, hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll, he sheepishly walks out)
WOMAN: (To Ruthie, the cashier) That man should really be in a sanitarium. (Ruthie nods, agreeing)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: George's old bedroom]
(The Maestro, Kramer, and Frank are all pant-less and playing pool while listening to classical music. Frank is looking at the Maestro's pictures with a magnifying glass)
KRAMER: Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased.
FRANK: It's him! (Standing up) It's Carlo Costanza!
KRAMER: Come on. Are you sure?
(They all crowd around the picture)
FRANK: I'd know him anywhere.
MAESTRO: I've seen that man in Tuscany. Eccentric fellow. Reputation of being kind of a village idiot.
FRANK: I still say we're related.
MAESTRO: (Recognizing the currently playing song) Ohh, I love this piece. (Turns it up, then pantomimes that he is conducting the instruments)
KRAMER: Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot.
FRANK: (Complaining) I can't make anything..
KRAMER: (Like a professional) Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.
FRANK: Follow through? What do you mean?
KRAMER: Right here, come on, I'll show you.. (Gets behind Frank, holding the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly..
(Estelle walks in with a tray of beverages and popcorn. Kramer and Frank continue the lesson in their underwear as she stares in disbelief)
FRANK: It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.
ESTELLE: Oh, my God!
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
JERRY: (Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.
ELAINE: Well, have you ever considered writing new material?
JERRY: Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.
ELAINE: (Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?
JERRY: (Deeply sarcastic) No. You're never here.
ELAINE: (Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
JERRY: Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.
(Scene cuts to George's apartment. Sally answers the ringing phone)
SALLY: Hello?
JERRY: Hello, Susan? It's Jerry.
SALLY: Hi Jerry, it's Sally!
JERRY: (Disappointed) Oh. Is George there?
SALLY: No, but he should be home soon.
JERRY: Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.
SALLY: Is this for your comedy routine?
JERRY: (Obviously resents talking to her) Yes.
SALLY: (Gasps) Don't worry. (Like a detective) I'm on the case.
(Jerry makes a face of doubt as he hangs up)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: George's old bedroom]
(The same pool game is going on. The Maestro is putting his pants on)
MAESTRO: (Sighs slightly) I, uh, think I'll get some air. (Slowly leaves)
KRAMER: Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..) You know where it's going..
(Scene ends)
[Setting: The Charles Grodin Show dressing room]
(Elaine enters)
ELAINE AND JERRY: Hey!
ELAINE: Is George here?
JERRY: Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy.
(Elaine gasps. Smiling, she walks over to him)
ELAINE: It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?
CARRERAS: My pleasure. (Reaches for a pen as Elaine unravels her poster)
ELAINE: (As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his "That's a shame" face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.
JERRY: (Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled "Ori-dent") Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!
ELAINE: (Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?
JERRY: Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.
ELAINE: (Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing?
JERRY: Well, I want to sit down.
ELAINE: So?
JERRY: It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a "Tada!" gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say "I'll see ya.", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: George's old bedroom]
(The game is over)
MAESTRO: (Making his exit, he lays the charm on Mrs. Costanza) Madame, you have been an extremely gracious hostess. (Kisses her hand)
ESTELLE: (Coy) Ohh.. thank you, Maestro. (Giggles to herself as the Maestro leaves)
FRANK: (Holding up a picture) Here, take a look at this.
ESTELLE: (Looking at it) Yeah, what is it?
FRANK: It's Carlo. I found him!
ESTELLE: (Handing the picture back) You've been cooped up in this room too long.
FRANK: (Yelling out) You never support me! Let's see what George says about this.. Where're my pants? (Takes his pair off a rack and leaves)
KRAMER: (Taking his pair off, he inspects them) Aw, beautiful!
(Scene ends)
[Setting: The Charles Grodin Show dressing room]
(Sally walks in with a bag. Jerry's sitting without any pants on)
SALLY: Hey there, Mr. Hairy legs!
JERRY: (Surprised to see her, he gets up) Where's George?
SALLY: Don't worry, I brought your doll.. (Pulls out an extremely different doll - this one resembles a baker) Tada!
JERRY: (Complaining) No! That's the wrong doll!
SALLY: Jerry, I saw the doll you were talking about - not funny! This doll's much funnier. Look, it has a little bowtie, and a cute little hat.. I think it's a riot!
JERRY: (Slow whispering) This is a nightmare.
SALLY: Oh well, I'll be watching. (Sets the doll down, then crosses her fingers) Don't screw up. (Leaves)
(View shifts over to Carreras. While eating some BBQ food he reaches back for a towel to wipe his face. He happens upon Jerry's pants) Too much sauce.. (Wipes his mouth)
JERRY: My pants!
(A stagehand enters)
STAGEHAND: Mr. Seinfeld, you're on.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: NYC street]
(Elaine's walking down with the poster and the box. A man exiting an ice cream parlor almost runs into her. Scene cuts to her on the subway. The man standing next to her is bumped, and his beverage spills all over Elaine. Luckily, she held the poster up before it could be damaged. Scene cuts to the Maestro's office)
MAESTRO: Elaine? What a surprise.
ELAINE: I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.
MAESTRO: Ohh.. (Looking at the box) Ori-dent - that electric toothbrush I've heard so much about..
ELAINE: No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this.
(The Maestro takes the poster, dramatically rolling the rubber band off. He unravels the poster on his desk)
MAESTRO: Ohh, what a sweet gesture. And autographed poster of my favorite tenor, with.. those two other guys. Oh, Elaine, this is magnifico!
ELAINE: Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany..
STAGEHAND: (Yelling from off-camera) Maestro, you're on!
MAESTRO: Oh, Elaine.. wait for me after the concert? We'll celebrate.
ELAINE: Oh, ok! (Picking up the Ori-dent box, she knocks over a bottle of wine. It spills all over the poster)
(Scene cuts to the Maestro's concert. Various players are practicing as he walks out. A round of applause sounds as the Maestro bows. Picking up his bent baton, he addresses the orchestra. As he starts to instruct the band, he stops when he finds out his baton is bent out of shape. He turns and looks at the audience apologetically as the music fades to a stop)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: George and Susan's apartment]
(Susan's holding her doll defensively)
SUSAN: I want to know why you took my doll out of the house.
GEORGE: I just wanted a second opinion.
(There's a knock at the door. George sighs, then answers it - it's Frank)
FRANK: (Holding up the picture) Take a look at this. Doesn't that look like my flesh and blood? Of course, your mother- (His attention is drawn over to Susan's doll. Like George did earlier, he starts to imagine that the doll is scolding him as his wife would)
DOLL: Oh, stop bothering everybody with that picture. It's ridiculous!
FRANK: (Walking toward the doll) Ridiculous?! I'll show you ridiculous! (Struggles with Susan for possession of the doll) Come here!
SUSAN: (Pleading) No, Mr. Costanza! No, no!
(Frank manages to get the doll from Susan. He twists the head clean off the body)
FRANK: (Holding out the head in his hand, he addresses it) There! Now what have you got to say for yourself?!
GEORGE: (To Susan) I told you it looked like her..
(Scene ends)
[Setting: A street in Tuscany]
(Frank meets up with a man sweeping the sidewalk - the man he believes to be his cousin)
FRANK: (Sets a gift he's brought down) Carlo! It's me, Frank! (Attempts to hug the guy, but he resists - pushing Frank away. He scolds Frank in another language) I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo?
MAN: Carlo? No. Mi nome e Giuseppe.
FRANK: (Realizing) What do you know.. Alright. (Picking up his present) I guess I was wrong. (Walks off)
(Scene ends)
[Opening Monologue]
The other thing I love is when you're in the middle of a dream, and the alarm goes off. You incorporate the sound of the alarm into the dream, so you can keep sleeping. And you'll make any adjustment in the dream to do it. I was with Marie Antoinette in a dream last night, and she was on the guillotine, the blade came down, her head fell into the basket, it rolled over and she started singing Neil Diamond's 'Solitary Man'. And, I thought, "That is not my alarm going off. This is actually happening."
[Street, New York]
(An elated George leaps around the corner, kicking a cab's door closed and clapping his hands together.)
GEORGE: (joyful) June. It's June.
(George begins trotting down the street. He acknowledges a passerby and high-fives him.)
GEORGE: (high-fiving) Hey!
(George continues his joyful path along the sidewalk, with his hands raised above his head in celebration.)
GEORGE: It's June. Mark's Michelle is a dog.
(George takes the hand of a female passerby and dances a few steps with her, twirling her round.)
GEORGE: June, June, June.
(Releasing the woman, George euphorically prances along, laughing and smiling.)
GEORGE: (to passerby) Hey, he-hah. It's June, June.
(George leaps onto the footing of a streetlight and spins on it, in time-honoured musical fashion.)
GEORGE: It's Juu-uu-une! Hey hay. Yes.
(George leaps from the streetlight onto the road, where he spreads his arms and spins.)
GEORGE: I love Juu-uuu-uu-uune!
(A car brakes behind George and sounds its horn. George flinches, and jigs nervously out from in front of the automobile and back to the pavement.
[Jerry's Apartment]
(George pushes open the door and enters, still ebullient. He punches the air as he looks to Jerry.)
GEORGE: June. Juune, baby!
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: The catering hall screwed up. The wedding is delayed until June. It's like a stay of execution.
JERRY: Dead man walking.
GEORGE: (pointing to Jerry in joyous agreement) Ha-ha-hah. This is my lucky day.
JERRY: Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad.
GEORGE: Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. Susan's best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend.
JERRY: She did?
GEORGE: Yeah.
JERRY: So? Wheels?
GEORGE: In motion. The wheels are in motion.
JERRY: Beautiful.
GEORGE: Aah, hey. (enthusiastic) If this works out, forget about it. Vacations together, movies together, dinner together. It..it's almost as good as if I didn't get married.
JERRY: So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club.
GEORGE: The Friars Club?
JERRY: Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for membership.
(Kramer opens the door and leans in.)
KRAMER: Hey everybody. (to Jerry) Listen, uh, do me a favour, will you? I got a hot date tonight with Connie. Knock on my door, wake me up in twenty minutes, alright?
JERRY: Catnap?
KRAMER: No, no, no, no. (comes in) This is evolutionary. I been reading this book, on Leonardo de Vinci. See, that means 'from Vinci', d'you know that?
JERRY: (deadpan) That must be some book.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm awake per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have lived the equivalent of a hundred an
