h a prestigious occupation. But it's really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesn't it? "I really am a doctor you know. You think I'm not, just check it out." I don't know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. "Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and I'll give you my opinion." After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what they're talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants.
[At a restaurant.]
GEORGE: Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive.
SASHA: Twenty five dollars.
GEORGE: Yes, well, you know, I'm not thinking about the price. You know you're the only woman I've never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.
SASHA: George, George, uh, I think we have to talk. I think we have a problem.
GEORGE: We do?
SASHA: We can't keep seeing each other.
GEORGE: Why?
SASHA: (crying) Because it's over. (sob, sob, sob) It's my parents George, the differences in our religion. Oh George, can you ever forgive me? (sob)
WAITER:: Uh, have you decided yet?
SASHA: (crying) Yes. I'll have the lobster.
GEORGE: Um, you know I'm starting to think that maybe lobster isn't the way to go.
[The hallway outside Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY: Then he asked you out?
ELAINE: We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.
JERRY: On your heart?
ELAINE: Jerry, the man is a doctor.
JERRY: Doctor? He's a podiatrist.
ELAINE: So, it's the same thing.
JERRY: Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school.
ELAINE: Really?
TAWNI: Hello.
JERRY: Oh hi.
TAWNI: Are you going to be stopping by later?
JERRY: Yes, I'll be stopping.
TAWNI: Ok, see you later.
JERRY: See you later. (to Elaine) Well we can't all be dating podiatrists. (Elaine laughs)
(They enter Jerry's apartment. George is laying on the couch)
GEORGE: It's over.
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: How did you get in?
GEORGE: Kramer.
ELAINE: What's that? (points at some foil on the table)
GEORGE: Lobster.
JERRY: Looks like a swan.
GEORGE: She says we can't go out anymore.
ELAINE: Why?
GEORGE: Because I'm not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents won't let her get involved with anyone who isn't Latvian Orthodox.
ELAINE: Latvian Orthodox? (gasps) Mmm, it is lobster.
JERRY: She's limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.
GEORGE: I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well that's not entirely true.
(Jerry hands Elaine a folk and they dig into the lobster)
JERRY: Oh, whatever.
ELAINE: Mmm, this is delicious.
JERRY: Mmm, succulent.
GEORGE: She knew I didn't have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didn't seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman.
ELAINE: Why don't you just ask her parents?
GEORGE: I can't. I met them. They're devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting.
JERRY: To Latvian Orthodox?
GEORGE: Why not? What do I care?
JERRY: You know it's not like changing toothpaste.
ELAINE: I think it would be romantic.
GEORGE: Really?
ELAINE: Yeah, it's like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh.
GEORGE: King Edward. (snapping his fingers) King Edward, Jerry.
JERRY: Yeah well King Edward didn't live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.
GEORGE: You know what? I could probably do this. What's the difference.
ELAINE: George I was just kidding around.
GEORGE: No. I wouldn't even have to tell her. I could surprise her.
ELAINE: George I wasn't serious.
GEORGE: How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this.
(George leaves.)
ELAINE: I guess this one is my fault.
JERRY: Oh yeah.
[At Tawni's apartment]
TAWNI: (kiss, kiss, kiss) Oh that was nice. Have you always been such a good kisser?
JERRY: Oh I don't know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing.
TAWNI: Well it was worth it. (kiss) I'll be (kiss) right (kiss) back (kiss). Where are you going?
JERRY: To wash my hands. They're sticky from the orange.
TAWNI: Meet you back here?
JERRY: Right there.
(Jerry goes into the bathroom and washes his hands. He sees the medicine cabinet open slightly and peeks in. )
JERRY: (thinking to himself; picks up a tube) "Fungicide". Fungus?
[At Monk's.]
(Jerry, Kramer, and Elaine eating at the normal booth)
JERRY: Fungicide. I mean what could she have?
ELAINE: I don't know.
KRAMER: Fungus.
JERRY: Exactly
ELAINE: So what did you say?
JERRY: I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home.
ELAINE: I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?
JERRY: I didn't open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.
ELAINE: You were snooping.
JERRY: I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldn't do that.
KRAMER: I would. I always open medicine cabinets.
ELAINE: Well I trust people not to do that.
KRAMER: Big mistake.
JERRY: Why don't you ask that doctor what it is?
ELAINE: What? Now he's a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.
JERRY: But that's what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. They're knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus.
ELAINE: I am not going to ask him about funguses.
KRAMER: Fungi.
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: Fungi.
[In the priest's office.]
FATHER-PRIEST: Why do you want to accept the Latvian Orthodox faith?
GEORGE: (ahem) In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um… (trying to think of a word)
FATHER-PRIEST: Enigmatic?
GEORGE: No.
FATHER-PRIEST: Vast? (he pronounces it as "vost")
GEORGE: No not vast (he pronounces it as "vost")
FATHER-PRIEST: Well whatever it is, basically you like the religion.
GEORGE: Yes.
FATHER-PRIEST 2: Is there one aspect of the faith that you find particularly attractive?
GEORGE: (he thinks) I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious.
FATHER-PRIEST: Are you familiar with Orthodox theology?
GEORGE: Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah.
FATHER-PRIEST: Plot?
GEORGE: Yes. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that.
FATHER-PRIEST 2: Well it's obvious that you are sincere in your desire.
GEORGE: Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in?
FATHER-PRIEST: The first step would be to familiarize yourself with these texts (brings out a pile of books).
GEORGE: Ah hah. You see Father, I'm I'm incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, don't you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change?
(Sister Roberta enters)
SISTER ROBERTA: Oh I'm sorry. Father, there's a man waiting in the chapel.
FATHER-PRIEST: You may attend to it Sister, oh this is George Costanza. He is interested in joining the church.
SISTER ROBERTA: Oh are you? That's wonderful. Well good luck to you.
(They bow back and forth; Sister Roberta leaves)
GEORGE: Nice nun.
FATHER-PRIEST: No, Sister Roberta is not a nun. She is what we call a novice.
FATHER-PRIEST 2: She won't be taking her final vows until next Thursday.
[In the chapel.]
SISTER ROBERTA: May I help you?
KRAMER: Oh yeah, I'm here to pick up my friend George Costanza.
SISTER ROBERTA: Well he's in with the Father.
KRAMER: Oh yeah.
SISTER ROBERTA: I'm Sister Roberta.
KRAMER: Oh. Kramer. Pleasure.
SISTER ROBERTA: Mine. (she smiles at Kramer)
[At Jerry's apartment.]
(George and Jerry in the kitchen area; George is taking a small cake out of a box)
GEORGE: I can't believe how easy it is. I'm virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and I'm in the club.
JERRY: That's all there is to it.
GEORGE: That's all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza.
JERRY: And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?
GEORGE: Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.
(Kramer enters. He is flinging a slinky.)
JERRY: Oh a slinky.
KRAMER: Sister Roberta gave it to me.
JERRY: Why did she give you that?
KRAMER: I think she liked me.
JERRY: What do you mean she liked you?
KRAMER: Liked me.
GEORGE: Kramer, they like everybody. They're friendly people.
KRAMER: No. I think I picked up on a vibe.
JERRY: You picked up on a vibe, from a nun.
KRAMER: Yeah, Jerry I'm telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it.
JERRY: Yea alright.
(ringing sounds from Kramer's apartment)
KRAMER: Oh, that's my phone.
(Kramer leaves. Jerry's girlfriend appears at the doorway.)
JERRY: Oh hi.
TAWNI: Hi, I just wanted to stop by and see how you were feeling.
JERRY: (weakly) A little better. (fake cough)
TAWNI: If you need anything let me know.
JERRY: Okay.
TAWNI: Okay.
JERRY: All right.
TAWNI: Bye.
JERRY: Bye.
(Tawni leaves; Jerry closes the door)
GEORGE: Story.
JERRY: She's subletting Carol's place for a month.
GEORGE: Yea, she likes you.
JERRY: Yeah but there's a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet.
GEORGE: So?
JERRY: So I don't know what she's using it for.
GEORGE: Well how do you even know it's hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube?
JERRY: I didn't even think to look.
GEORGE: Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.
JERRY: Yeah I've got this old bottle of cough medicine.
GEORGE: I still have brill cream.
[At Tawni's apartment. ]
(Jerry knocks on the door )
(knock, knock, knock)
JERRY: Hi
TAWNI: Hi.
JERRY: Hi. Can I use your bathroom?
[At the doctor's apartment.]
ELAINE: You sure you don't mind?
DOCTOR: No of course not. People ask me medical questions all the time.
ELAINE: Well I mean the question isn't even for me it's for a friend.
DOCTOR: Elaine, I'm used to it. I'm a doctor.
ELAINE: Well… podiatrist.
DOCTOR: Huh?
ELAINE: No no, I'm just saying you didn't really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which I'm sure is very grueling in it's own way.
DOCTOR: I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose to work with feet.
ELAINE: I like feet too. I'm just saying…
DOCTOR: Saying what?
[In Jerry's girlfriend's apartment. ]
(She knocks on the bathroom door.)
(knock, knock, knock)
TAWNI: How are you doing in there?
JERRY: Fine all done, just looking for the soap.
(Jerry is looking around for the bottle of fungicide.)
TAWNI: No soap?
JERRY: No I don't see it.
(Jerry finds the bottle of fungicide and picks it up. Jerry's girlfriend enters the bathroom with soap. Hastily, Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in his pocket.)
TAWNI: (giving Jerry the soap) Here you go.
[At George's parent's house.]
(George is in the bathroom with his Latvian Orthodox books.)
(knock, knock, knock)
ESTELLE: George what are you doing in there?
GEORGE: What? Nothing.
FRANK: You've been in there an hour.
ESTELLE: You don't feel well?
GEORGE: I'm fine.
ESTELLE: I want to know what you're doing in there.
GEORGE: Nothing.
FRANK: George, open the door.
GEORGE: No.
ESTELLE: Georgie.
GEORGE: No!
[At Kramer's apartment.]
(Sister Roberta is knocking on the door.)
(knock, knock, knock)
KRAMER: Hey.
SISTER ROBERTA: Good evening. I hope I'm not disturbing you, but I found another toy I thought you might like.
[At Jerry's Apartment.]
JERRY: Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And I'll need that in the form of a question.
GEORGE: I don't know. I can't believe they're making me take this test.
(Elaine enters.)
JERRY: Hey, did you talk to the doctor?
ELAINE: No.
JERRY: All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the bottle of fungicide.)
ELAINE: You took her medicine.
JERRY: Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again?
ELAINE: I don't know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists aren't real doctors.
JERRY: How could you say that?
ELAINE: It's you fault. You just got me thinking.
JERRY: I was merely speaking extemporaneously.
ELAINE: I've got nothing against the foot. I'm pro-foot.
JERRY: Me too.
ELAINE: Do you think I should call him and apologize?
JERRY: Yes. He's a doctor. (Elaine starts to leave. ) Wait a second. (Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in Elaine's purse.) (to George) What are you doing?
GEORGE: What does it look like I'm doing?
JERRY: (Reading words George wrote on his hand) "Matthew, Luke, Paul", what you're cheating on your conversion chest?
(Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: I told you.
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: I told you she liked me.
JERRY: Who?
KRAMER: Sister Roberta.
JERRY: How do you know?
KRAMER: She told me. She said she's never had a man stir up all of these feelings inside of her. She's questioning her faith. She's thinking of leaving the church.
JERRY: Wow
KRAMER: Oh, uh, this power. I'm dangerous Jerry, I'm very very dangerous.
[At the priest's office.]
FATHER-PRIEST: I must say George, I was somewhat surprised at the results of your conversion test. I don't recall having seen such an impressive performance. You truly must be filled with the spirit of the Lord.
GEORGE: Oh, I'm I'm full of it Father.
FATHER-PRIEST 2: (muttering something to Father-Priest 1) …(mumble)… Kramer …(mumble)…
FATHER-PRIEST: Yes, yes I see. (To George) I'm sorry something has come up.
GEORGE: Oh, I understand. (George exits; Sees Kramer in the hallway) Hey.
KRAMER: (rushed) Yea, Hey. (Kramer enters.) Um, you wanted to see me Father?
FATHER-PRIEST: Yes. Please, sit down. Sister Roberta came to see me yesterday.
KRAMER: I know what this is about Father. I didn't do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. It's just that, that I have this power.
FATHER-PRIEST: Yes. Kavorka.
KRAMER: Kavorka?
FATHER-PRIEST: It is a Latvian word which means "the lure of the animal".
KRAMER: I don't understand.
FATHER-PRIEST: Women are drawn to you. They would give anything to be possessed by you.
KRAMER: Help me Father. Help me.
FATHER-PRIEST: Yes, yes I will help you. Listen very carefully. I want you to buy ten cloves of garlic, three quarts of vinegar, six ounces…
[The hallway by Jerry's apartment]
JERRY: What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to Kramer's door) Ah hah.
(knock, knock, knock)
(Kramer opens his door. He is wearing a ring of garlics around his neck.)
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: Hey. What are you doing?
KRAMER: I've got the Kavorka Jerry.
JERRY: The Kavorka? What's that?
KRAMER: The lure of the animal. I'm dangerous.
JERRY: What is this thing around your neck?
KRAMER: The priests they're helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.
JERRY: You know you're funcifying the whole building.
KRAMER: Keep away Jerry. Keep away.
(He closes his door.)
JERRY: Kramer. (knock, knock, knock) Kramer.
[At the entrance of the church. There is a sign there. It reads: CONVERSION CEREMONY - FOR - GEORGE COSTANZA - 3:P.M. The sign is on a black background with white stick-on letters.]
(A woman reads the sign.)
WOMAN: George Costanza? Estelle's son?
[At George's parent's house.]
ESTELLE: Latvian Orthodox? Why are you doing this?
GEORGE: For a woman.
FRANK: A woman? What are you out of your mind?
ESTELLE: Why can't you do anything like a normal person?
FRANK: Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels?
GEORGE: No it's a regular religion.
FRANK: I'm calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to get out of this.
GEORGE: I don't want to get out of it.
ESTELLE: Bu George, you don't know what you're saying. You're under their control.
FRANK: What, they brainwashed you?
GEORGE: No no.
FRANK: You're not performing any rituals in this house.
ESTELLE: Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.
FRANK: And stay away from those squirrels.
[At Tawni's apartment.]
TAWNI: Oh how you doing Jerry?
JERRY: Good. What's the matter?
TAWNI: I'm tired. I hardly slept last night with all this scratching. Bonkers was going crazy.
JERRY: Bonkers?
TAWNI: My cat. He's got this weird sort of skin condition. Some type of fungus, I couldn't find his medicine.
JERRY: Oh it's your cat!
TAWNI: What?
JERRY: Ooh, nothing.
[At the church.]
FATHER-PRIEST: Are you ready my son?
GEORGE: Yes faddah.
FATHER-PRIEST: What did you say?
GEORGE: What?
FATHER-PRIEST: I thought you said faddah.
GEORGE: I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous.
FATHER-PRIEST: Ooh, of course.
[Outside on a sidewalk.]
(A woman is waiting for a cab. Kramer walks up to her.)
KRAMER: How you doing?
WOMAN: Get away from me you creep. (She walks away.)
KRAMER: Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta I've still got time to catch her.
[At the church. It is George's conversion ceremony.]
(Church music plays. George is dressed in a white church gown. He walks down the church aisle carrying a candle. Father-priest says some Latvian words. Kramer is running down the street going to the church. The church music is still playing. George takes a drink of some wine. He spills some on his gown. He makes a hand motion on his gown. Kramer is still running to the church.)
FATHER-PRIEST: Congratulations George. Welcome to the faith. Sister Roberta would you please offer the final benediction.
SISTER ROBERTA: (hesitates) I can't. (crowd murmurs) I'm sorry. It's a beautiful religion, but I am not worthy of it. I found something else.
(Kramer enters the church.)
SISTER ROBERTA: Him.
CROWD: Kavorka, Kavorka.
[At Elaine's apartment.]
ELAINE: (kiss, kiss) You know, because I love the foot. I'm a big fan of the foot.
DOCTOR: Well it's my fault. I got a little defensive.
ELAINE: And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe.
DOCTOR: It's my favorite toe.
ELAINE: Let's face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? You're not going to the ear guy.
DOCTOR: No you're not.
(phone rings)
ELAINE: I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: Oh uh, where's the bathroom?
ELAINE: It's right down here to the left. I will uh meet you right back here.
JERRY: Elaine it's her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back.
(The doctor is in Elaine's bathroom. He peeks into the medicine cabinet and finds the tube of fungicide.)
DOCTOR: (Thinking to himself) "Fungicide"? Fungus?
[At the church]
SISTER ROBERTA: Something's wrong. I don't feel the same lure.
KRAMER: You don't?
SISTER ROBERTA: What have I…? I must return to the church. By the way you really need to take a bath. You stink.
KRAMER: Yeah yeah.
[Closing Monologue]
JERRY: But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there, "Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin. Well I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on."
[At Monk's]
SASHA: For me?
GEORGE: Well I didn't do it for my mother.
SASHA: I'm really flattered. But I just don't feel ready to make a commitment yet. Maybe when I get back from Latvia.
GEORGE: Latvia?
SASHA: Yes. I'm going to stay with some relatives there for a year. Isn't it great?
GEORGE: Enjoy, enjoy.
SASHA: Oh George, you are so sweet. Don't ever change.
(She leaves)
GEORGE: I'd like a doggie bag for this please. (hands her plate to the waitress)
[opening monologue]
JERRY: The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.
[the bathroom]
ELAINE: Oh, I can't believe this. What a dope! uh..excuse me umm.. I'm sorry this is.. this is kind of embarrassing but.. there's no toilet paper over here
JANE: (from the stall on Elaine's right) Are you talking to me?
ELAINE: yeah.. I I just forgot to check so if you could just spare me some.
JANE: No I'm sorry
ELAINE: What?
JANE: No I'm sorry, I can't spare it
ELAINE: you can't spare it??
JANE: no there's not enough to spare
ELAINE: well I don't need much, just 3 squares will do it
JANE: I'm sorry I don't have a square to spare, now if you don't mind
ELAINE: 3 squares? you can't spare 3 squares??
JANE: no I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square
ELAINE: oh is it two-ply? cause it it's two-ply I'll take one ply, one ply, one puny little ply, I'll take one measly ply
JANE: look, I don't have a square and I don't have a ply (flushing and leaving)
ELAINE: No no, no no, don't don't, I beg you
[the movie theater]
(Jerry's girlfriend, Jane, returns and sits down)
JERRY: (eating pop corn) hmm I love this artificial flavoring I like it better than butter I think it's more consistent
JANE: you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
JERRY: what?
(offering pop corn to Jane)
(elsewhere in the same theater)
ELAINE: hey
TONY: Hey. Hey? where is my popcorn babe?
ELAINE: what?
TONY: my popcorn, you were supposed to get me popcorn what? would you forget about me babe?
ELAINE: you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
JANE: I mean.. a person needs a certain amount of toilet paper to be covered.. I simply could not spare it this woman just didn't get it, she kept harassing me
ELAINE: 3 squares!! that's all I was asking for! 3 squares!
JANE: she wouldn't stop "help me! help me!" she was insane
ELAINE: I was begging her "please! please!" she was insane
JERRY: who do you think she is? how dare she? you want me to get the manager? too bad they don't have those old ladies walking around with flashlights anymore we'd flush her out
JANE: I don't know what she looks like
JERRY: I wonder where Elaine is sitting? I really wanted you to meet her she's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend Tony
ELAINE: hmm where is Jerry sitting? he's supposed to be here tonight with his new girlfriend I'm dying to see what she looks like
TONY: hey? you think if I jumped off that balcony I'd get hurt?
[Jerry's apt.]
(Jerry's at his computer)
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: hey
JERRY: hey
KRAMER: hey guy, can I use your phone in your bedroom?
JERRY: what's the matter with yours?
KRAMER: huh.. my batteries are dead
JERRY: It's not one of those 976 calls, is it?
KRAMER: look come on, let me use it, 5 minutes, I'll pay you back huh?
JERRY: why do you do that?
KRAMER: oh... (goes to the bedroom)
(Elaine enters)
ELAINE: I am never going back to the movies again
JERRY: hey where were you last night? I looked for you, I didn't see you
ELAINE: I looked for you too, I was all the way over on the side
JERRY: oh with huh.. pretty boy.. Tony
ELAINE: yeah
JERRY: hey hey (fooling around with his collar)
ELAINE: yeah, all right ok
JERRY: Tony, hey hey (continues fooling)
ELAINE: that's nice. Listen, listen to this I am in the bathroom, right before the movie starts
JERRY: huh huh
ELAINE: I'm in the stall and there's no toilet paper
JERRY: no what?
ELAINE: toilet paper
JERRY: oh.. whoa..
ELAINE: so I ask this woman in the stall next to me for some and she refuses! ha ha
JERRY: well maybe she couldn't spare it
ELAINE: a square?
JERRY: well, you know, sometimes a square is everything
ELAINE: a ply?
JERRY: Elaine, you cannot judge a person on a situation like that. I mean it's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert
ELAINE: yeah
JERRY: it's battle conditions
ELAINE: yeah, well I just hope I run into her again ok, cause I will never forget that flinty voice, it is tattooed in my brain if I hear it, watch out So listen what happened with Jane last night?

ELAINE: the four of us are going out Saturday right? That should be fun
JERRY: yeah that should be real fun
ELAINE: you know what, it's getting late, can I call Tony?
JERRY: yeah
(Elaine picks up the wireless phone and presses for the tone)
WOMAN'S VOICE ON THE PHONE: then we'll get a cab and we'll do it in the back seat.. how's that Andre?
ELAINE: Andre?
(Jerry approaches and listens to the phone with Elaine)
KRAMER: (on the phone) what about the driver? we could get an accident
WOMAN so what?
KRAMER: oh that wouldn't be very good
JERRY: (on the phone) hey Andre, get the hell off the phone!
ELAINE: what, what is going on? what.. who is Andre?
JERRY: Kramer's Andre, he's fooling around with these 976 numbers (Kramer walks out of the bedroom) hey I told you, I don't want you doing that on my phone
KRAMER: Jerry, I'm telling you, this phone sex thing is hilarious, like this woman Erika, here look (showing the ad in the newspaper). You gotta call her, the voice she uses..
JERRY: hey you know it's weird because that voice sounded a little familiar to me
KRAMER: hey, you're hungry? Monk's?
JERRY: no I gotta go downtown
ELAINE: oh wait, you're giving me a lift home right?
JERRY: yeah
ELAINE: so listen, what happened last night with Jane?
JERRY: oh uh nothing, she just.. choked on a jujube
[Jerry's car]
ELAINE: you know I hate to tell you this, but it's time to defrost that freezer
JERRY: I know, I just can't bring myself to do it meanwhile that freezer keeps getting smaller and smaller (she smiles) (Elaine looks at her watch) oh, don't wanna keep Tony waiting
ELAINE: hey you got a problem with Tony?
JERRY: hunky.. Tony.. hey hey hey (fools around with his collar again)
ELAINE: ok, Jerry, I would be going out with him no matter what he looked like
JERRY: of course you would
ELAINE: oh yeah, oh.. like you're one to talk
JERRY: Elaine
ELAINE: what?
JERRY: different for a man
ELAINE: uh?
JERRY: we're expected to be superficial
ELAINE: I'm not being superficial
JERRY: Elaine, he's a.. he's a male bimbo, he's a mimbo
ELAINE: he's not a mimbo, he's an exciting, charismatic man he just happened to have a perfect face
JERRY: and that's why you're going out with him
ELAINE: no it is not
JERRY: you know, I think George has a non-sexual crush on him
ELAINE: I think he does too
JERRY: I mean, every time I see him, it's Tony this, Tony that. George is like a school girl around him
[Monk's]
TONY: so I said uh.. "hey dude, you better step off"
(Tony takes his cap and wears it backwards)
GEORGE: "step off"?
TONY: yeah
GEORGE: you said "step off"? wow, that is too much hey..huh hey (George turns the cap his wearing backwards like Tony) Tony, I huh, I just had this brainstorm for us. Can you guess what it is?
TONY: no

GEORGE: rush? you want a rush? drop a ball on your toe my friend, talk about a rush, you'll be throbbing, you'll see visions

JERRY: cool guy? what are you, in 8th grade?
GEORGE: he's the first cool guy I've ever been friends with in my whole life. You know.. it's a different world when you're with a cool guy, he's not afraid of anybody. You should hear the way he talks to waitresses.. he gets free pie!
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: hey

GEORGE: horning on my rock climbing trip. It's just supposed to be me and Tony
KRAMER: he asked me

GEORGE: what?.. that's ridiculous!
KRAMER: no no no, I don't think so. You love him
GEORGE: you better be careful on those rocks tomorrow buddy. And you're not getting any sandwiches either
(phone rings, Kramer answers)
JERRY: you're making sandwiches?
KRAMER: hello

(Kramer and George are hanging on a rock)
KRAMER: (singing) yodel lay hee hoo! yodel lay hee hoo! hello! (Kramer jumps around George from one side to an other)
ECHO: hello

TONY: (voice from below) George! Kramer!
KRAMER: yeah!
TONY: take the rope, thread it through the carabiniere and knot it, and I'll climb up to where you are
KRAMER: alright.. George you got it? (gives him the rope)
GEORGE: yeah
TONY: hey George, you got anything to eat dude?
GEORGE: (taking it out of his jacket pocket) yeah I got some sandwiches.. I got tuna.. and salmon salad Tony because I know you don't like peanut butter
(the ropes slides down)
KRAMER: what?

GEORGE & KRAMER: ahh.....!!

ELAINE: what is with the gum?
JERRY: I know it's a big problem.. she puts like four pieces in her mouth, it's ridiculous, I don't think we're gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
ELAINE: because of the gum
JERRY: well it's too much, it's embarrassing
ELAINE: why does she have to chew so many?
JERRY: she's one of these people, always have to be different

(whispering)
GEORGE: she's there, I can hear her
KRAMER: alright, who's gonna tell her
GEORGE: huh you tell her
KRAMER: it was your fault
GEORGE: if you hadn't come, this whole thing wouldn't have happen (back on Jerry and Elaine's side, we can hear George saying "I was the one who was invited", Jerry opens the door)
JERRY: well
ELAINE: hey
GEORGE & KRAMER: hey

ELAINE: did you have fun
GEORGE & KRAMER: yeah
KRAMER: for a little while
ELAINE: where's Tony?

KRAMER: whoa whoa ginga, you were supposed to tie the knot

KRAMER: it was a big rock
GEORGE: we rode along all the way to the hospital
KRAMER: yeah I sang 99 bottles of beer on the wall
(Elaine rushes out)
JERRY: well aside from that from that, how did he like the sandwiches?
[Tony's]
ELAINE: so huh, what did the doctors say?
TONY: they said huh.. they said I'm coming along (Tony's face is covered by bandages)
ELAINE: but what else did they say
TONY: well, they said huh Tony, try to keep it clean
ELAINE: right yeah.. no I mean did they get into stuff like a.. long jagged scars or.. gross deformities, major skin grafts, stuff like that
TONY: I really don't remember, I was kinda out of it for the 1st couple of days, I was on a lot of medication, it was kinda like haze, it was pretty cool
ELAINE: huh (smiles) but huh, in this medicated haze, in this woozy state, um do you recall the words.. radical reconstructive surgery being uttered?
TONY: I don't know, I don't know
ELAINE: think Tony, think
TONY: I'm drawing a blank, babe
(knock on door)
ELAINE: Excuse me.
(Elaine gets it, it's George)
GEORGE: Hi Elaine
ELAINE: this isn't a very good time George
GEORGE: I just wanted to talk to Tony for a minute (hands Elaine some stuff)
TONY: step off George, I don't wanna see you
GEORGE: me? "step off"

GEORGE: I I just.. but..
ELAINE: Bye bye (shuts the door) oh.. (opens it back) George wait wait
GEORGE: yes?
ELAINE: would you throw this trash out (closes the door)
[Jerry's]
(Jane is giving Jerry a massage)
JERRY: I've been waiting a while for this. You know it's a shame Tony got all banged up, we're not gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
JANE: Oh that is too bad, what a shame
JERRY: yeah, it's a damn shame, a damn shame!
JANE: well maybe he's feeling better
JERRY: yeah without a doubt, I'm down (Kramer enters) oh hey how're you doing? Jane this is my neighbor Kramer
KRAMER: hey
JANE: hello Kramer (he acts all weird, a la Kramer)
KRAMER: well hello Jane
JANE: Jerry told me so much about you, I feel like I know you intimately
KRAMER: (very quickly) oh I don't think so, no we never met, I never talked to you before on the phone, alright I'll see you later buddy
JERRY: wait, where are you going? where are you going?
KRAMER: uptown, to the Y

JERRY: alright I changed my mind, uh yeah I don't think I'm not gonna go now
JANE: well ok I'll see you later,
JERRY: Ok.
JANE: nice meeting you
JERRY:See ya. (Jane Leaves; after the door closes Kramer jumps in shock) what's with you?
KRAMER: that's her
JERRY: who?
KRAMER: Erika, she's Erika
JERRY: oh you think she's Erika, the phone sex woman
KRAMER: Jerry, that voice is tattooed on my brain, I'm telling you it's her
JERRY: oh you're crazy
KRAMER: Am I? Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind?
JERRY: It's impossible
KRAMER: iIs it? Or is it so possible your heard is spinning like a top?
JERRY: it can't be
KRAMER: Can't it? Or is your entire world just crashing down all around you?
JERRY: alright that's enough
KRAMER: yeaaaaah!
[Monk's]
ELAINE: he's supposed to get the bandages off on Sunday.. what if?
JERRY: what?
ELAINE: you know (acts like a monster)
JERRY: oh you're afraid he might look like Zippy the pinhead
ELAINE: yeah I mean, I mean what is my obligation here, you know we were just dating, it was probably gonna be over in a couple of weeks anyway
JERRY: oh I though you didn't care about his looks
ELAINE: I lied
JERRY: aha
ELAINE: are you kidding, he's a mimbo I know that.. but he's my mimbo, you know and even if he is a hideous freak maybe, maybe I can learn to love him, maybe in some final irony (Jerry is looking the other way), I'll learn what love really is. You know Jerry
JERRY: oh I'm sorry I didn't get most of that.. isn't that Kramer over there?
ELAINE: yeah, yeah
JERRY: hey Kramer
KRAMER: what? hey (walks by Jerry and Elaine's table) it's all set
JERRY: what's all set?
KRAMER: Erika is gonna meet me here, now we're gonna find out the truth
JERRY: how's you get her to meet here?
KRAMER: I don't know, we have a certain chemistry
(Jane shows up and when she sees Jerry, she walks by their table, smiling)
JERRY: oh my god
JANE: hi I thought I'd find you here
JERRY: hello.. Erika
JANE: Erika? what are you talking about?
JERRY: how can u say things like that over the phone?
JANE: what things? What are you talking about?
JERRY: selling sexual pleasure over the phone?
JANE: I sell paper goods you jerk
JERRY: paper goods?
ELAINE: excuse me, do you have a tissue?
JANE: No, I'm sorry, I can't spare it, there's not enough to spare
(Elaine realizes)
JANE: Where's the ladies' room (Kramer points her)
ELAINE: I have to go to the bathroom too (runs to be ahead of Jane; Jane stops and looks back at Jerry; Jerry shugs)
[monk's: the bathroom]
JANE: oh damn
ELAINE: something.. wrong?
JANE: yeah there's no toilet paper in here, I usually check but would you mind?
ELAINE: I can't, I don't have it, I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square
JANE: Hey, wait a minute, I know you
ELAINE: that's right honey, and I know you!
(Elaine gets out and she has an arms full of toilet paper)
JANE: no, no, no!!!
[Monk's]
(Elaine after exiting the bathroom very satisfied, walks towards Jerry and gives him the rolls)
ELAINE: here, take it
JERRY: thanks
JANE: (walks out of the bathroom, very furious; to Jerry) don't call me anymore
(Jerry doesn't say anything and waves his hands)
(Jane walks by Kramer and turns back)
JANE: (to Kramer, in a very sensual voice) you either
(sticks her tongue out)
(Kramer and Jerry look at each other, with their mouths open)
[Closing monologue]
JERRY: Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going "boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly."
[Opening Monologue]
It is my opinion that we never should have landed a man on the moon. It's a mistake. Now everything is compared to that one accomplishment. Now every body goes "I can't believe they could land a man on the moon . . . and taste my coffee!" I think we all would have been a lot happier if we hadn't landed a man on the moon. Then we'd go, They can't make a prescription bottle top that's easy to open? I'm not surprised they couldn't land a man on the moon. Things make perfect sense to me now. Neil Armstrong should have said, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for every whining, complaining, SOB on the face of the earth."
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Elaine is touching up her make-up at the table)
ELAINE: Hey, do you believe I got Happy New Yeared today? It's February.
JERRY: I once got Happy New Yeared in March.
ELAINE: It's disgusting.
JERRY: It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?
ELAINE: Really cold.
JERRY: Scary cold.
ELAINE: I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
(George enters in Gore-Tex jacket -- it's huge/all puffed out)
JERRY: That. (pointing at George)
ELAINE: (Laughing as she says it) What is that, ha?
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: When did you get that?
GEORGE: This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?
JERRY: You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?
(George turns and closes the apartment door)
ELAINE: Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing.
JERRY: Look at this
(They both start hitting George's jacket a lot)
ELAINE: Hey George, can you feel this? Can you ...
(George stands there, looking at them as they continue hitting his jacket)
GEORGE: All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go.
ELAINE: Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.
JERRY: Yeah. (pointing at Elaine as he goes into the bedroom)
GEORGE: What for?
ELAINE: These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.
GEORGE: Why?
ELAINE: Because it's rude, otherwise.
GEORGE: You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?
ELAINE: Yes.
GEORGE: So you're telling me instead of them being happy to see me, they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. Ttst --You see what I'm saying?
JERRY: The fabric of society is very complex George.
GEORGE: I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.
ELAINE: Ya can't bring Pepsi. (Elaine starts putting on her coat and gloves)
GEORGE: Why not?
ELAINE: Because we're adults?
GEORGE: You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh (snort), no way wine is better than Pepsi.
JERRY: I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table.
GEORGE: I just don't like the idea that any time there's a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.
JERRY: You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: All right, let's go. Who's driving? (claps his hands and rubs them together)
JERRY: You are. I can't get that thing in my car. (referring to George)
KRAMER: Uh huh.
[In Kramer's car]
JERRY: Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Just give me a little squeeze.
ELAINE: Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off, Get off of Me!
KRAMER hehehehehe (low tone chuckle)
GEORGE: Hehehehehe (higher tone laugh, though still quietly )
JERRY: You're pretty comfortable up there eh, Bubble boy?
GEORGE: Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.
ELAINE: You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.
GEORGE: Oh, here we go...
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: Why don't we get them a couch? (Kramer laughs) We'll rent a U-haul -- we'll bring 'em a nice sectional.
KRAMER: (low tone)Yeahhehehehe
ELAINE: We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery?
KRAMER: (low tone) All right, yeah.
GEORGE: Why don't you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store?
ELAINE: Ring Dings?
GEORGE: Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you're gonna get at a bakery.
KRAMER: Ooooh I like Ring Dings.
ELAINE: George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.
KRAMER: HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON! (shouting out the window)
GEORGE: (to Kramer) It's a funeral procession. . . . (to Elaine) And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me, "just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we, Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .
ELAINE: Oh, Kramer, that's the bakery. Stop here. Stop here.
KRAMER: (low tone) All right.
ELAINE: Okay, let me out. You, eh, whatever your name is…
JERRY: Jerry.
ELAINE: Yeah, Jerry, Jerry -- come with me.
KRAMER: Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here in ten minutes.
ELAINE: Yeah.
KRAMER: All right
[The Royal Bakery]
ELAINE: Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries.
JERRY: Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie.
ELAINE: Mmm.
JERRY: I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?
ELAINE: You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
JERRY: I'm looking forward to it.
ELAINE: Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.
JERRY: Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?
ELAINE: CHOCOLATE BABKA! That's their specialty.
JERRY: Love that babka.
ELAINE: Yeah, yeah!
JERRY: So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.
ELAINE: Why?
JERRY: I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.
(holding an imaginary box by the string - pinky finger extended)
ELAINE: You think it's effeminate?
JERRY: It's a tad dainty.
ELAINE: Oh, we forgot to pick a number.
JERRY: Oh, see that's not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people.
ELAINE: I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers?
JERRY: Ah, no, forget it.
ELAINE: No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask 'em. Come on. . . . Excuse me.
[Kramer's car]
KRAMER: (exhales) Well, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?
GEORGE: Ah, Just double park.
KRAMER: No, no.
GEORGE: Why not?
KRAMER: I'll get a ticket! Besides, what if somebody wants to get out of here?
GEORGE: Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give 'em up.
KRAMER: That's a fallacy.
GEORGE: All right, I'll tell you what... why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?
KRAMER: Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?
GEORGE: Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.
KRAMER: So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heat 'll be on.
GEORGE: Does the heater even work in this car?
KRAMER: No.
GEORGE: Oh, Hey, eh, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see
KRAMER: I see.
GEORGE: You see, hu, ho ho.
[Royal Bakery]
ELAINE: But we were here ahead of you.
BARBARA: How do I know that?
JERRY: Well we saw you come in.
DAVID: Well, that's easy for you to say.
ELAINE: Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries.
CLERK: 46?
ELAINE: Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?
BARBARA: Yes.
ELAINE: Oh my god. I, I know you. I-I'm, I'm Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.
BARBARA: I'm on my way over there right now.
ELAINE: Yeah me too.
DAVID: You're Jerry right?
JERRY: David!
(Jerry and David put their hands to their respective chins, thinking about the situation)
ELAINE: Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?
BARBARA: Yes it is.
ELAINE: You know we were here, ahead of you.
BARBARA: You're NOT getting my number.
JERRY: Oh so you still don't believe us.
CLERK: 47!
BARBARA: That's Us.
ELAINE: Ohhh, OK, fine, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are.
BARBARA: Well, I'll be there ahead of you and I'LL be telling them what a jerk YOU are. . . . (turns to the counter) I'll have the chocolate babka.
CLERK: You're lucky Mrs. Benedict it's our last one.
(Elaine and Jerry's knees buckle and both have an anguished look when they hear about the last chocolate babka)
[Liquor Store]
GEORGE: Alright, what are we getting? It's hot in here!
(Kramer looking around the store at the wines, he smacks his hands together and rubs)
KRAMER: Ooo, What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?
GEORGE: What's that?
KRAMER: Well its a Bordeaux. Robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais -- which is richer and fruitier. Ahh, here's one. Twelve dollars.
GEORGE: Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you they're not getting no twelve dollar cake.
KRAMER: All right look, I am going to have to pay you back later. I don't have my wallet.
(George swaggers over to Kramer)
GEORGE: . . . Why not?
KRAMER: Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter. (makes a motion with his hips)
GEORGE: "throws your hips off kilter" So where's your money? (pulls out his wallet)
KRAMER: I never take it.
GEORGE: So what do you do?
KRAMER: Oh, I get by.
[Royal Bakery]
BARBARA: See you later (exits with the babka)
ELAINE & JERRY: See you later.
JERRY: That's the last babka. They got the last babka.
ELAINE: I know. They're going in first with the last babka.
JERRY: That was our babka.
ELAINE: You can't beat a babka.
JERRY: We had that babka.
ELAINE: (exhales) They're going to be heroes.
JERRY: Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless.
ELAINE: Well how about a carrot cake?
JERRY: Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.
ELAINE: Black Forrest?
JERRY: Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.
JERRY: How about a Napoleon?
ELAINE: Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele.
JERRY: That was our babka. We had that babka!
ELAINE: What's this one?
CLERK: That, Cinnamon Babka.
ELAINE: (gasp)
JERRY: Another babka?
CLERK: There's chocolate and there's cinnamon.
JERRY: Well-well we got to get the cinnamon.
ELAINE: No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka.
JERRY: I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, "Oh This is so good. What's in it?" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not.
CLERK: 49?
ELAINE: I'll have a cinnamon babka.
JERRY: … and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!
(Jerry puts up the 2 finger peace sign and smiles)
[Liquor store]
(The clerk puts the wine bottle in a brown paper bag and sets it on the counter)
CLERK: That'll be 13.05
GEORGE: All right here you go.
KRAMER: Yeuu.
CLERK: A hundred? I can't change that.
GEORGE: You can't - huhu, All right let's go.
KRAMER: Wait a second. I can get change.
(Kramer and George walk out to the sidewalk.)
[Out on the street]
KRAMER: Hey, anybody got change for a hundred?
GEORGE: Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! You'll get us killed!
KRAMER: What?
GEORGE: Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us.
KRAMER: Alright, Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change.
GEORGE: I am not buying something just to get change.
KRAMER: George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on.
(Kramer buttons his jacket up and goes over to the news stand, George stands there for a second then goes over.)
(At the News stand)
GEORGE: All right, what are we doing?
KRAMER: Just get some gum or something.
(George pick up the gum)
GEORGE: Pack of gum. Here you go. (hands the clerk a $100 bill)
CLERK: What is it a hundred? I can't change a hundred.
GEORGE: Why not?
CLERK: You got to buy more than that.
KRAMER: Here, get a newspaper. (Kramer hands George a Newspaper)
GEORGE: Newspaper.
CLERK: Not enough.
KRAMER: Clark Bar. (Kramer starts tearing the candy wrapper open with his teeth.)
GEORGE: Clark Bar.
CLERK: Keep going.
GEORGE: We're up to two dollars here.
KRAMER: Here, George, get a Penthouse Forum.
GEORGE: I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum.
(George grabs the Forum and walks a few steps over by the magazines -- Kramer follows him )
KRAMER: Why? No, that'll make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the letters at the dinner table.
GEORGE: Oh, that's nice.
(Kramer takes a bite of the Clark Bar)
KRAMER: Come on, did you ever read one of these?
(Kramer take the forum from George and starts to leaf through it)
GEORGE: It's not real. They're all made up.
KRAMER: Ohh, it's real.
GEORGE: Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! (grabs the forum from Kramer and walks over to the clerk) . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.
(Kramer takes the forum back and starts reading, he takes a bite of the Clark bar.)
CLERK: 6.75.
GEORGE: Ah, great. All right, with the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now.
KRAMER: All right, all right.
(A man bumps ito George)
MAN1: (gibberish Arabic yelling) ...Big Coat! Big Coat!
GEORGE: Yes, I'm Sorry, it's a new coat. It-it's Gore-Tex.
KRAMER: You better be careful with that thing... You'll start a war.
[Royal Bakery]
(Jerry and Elaine are waiting in line, Jerry takes a bite of his cookie and then speaks)
JERRY: Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved.
ELAINE: Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. (Op-Ed stands for Opinions and Editorials)
JERRY: Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie.
(Jerry sees a black man on the other side of the bakery eating the same cookie -- Jerry raises his cookie up and so does the man -- in a moment of racial harmony & unity to which he just spoke of.)
ELAINE: (looking in the box) Well what is this?
JERRY: What?
ELAINE: It's a hair.
JERRY: Oh, oh take it back. Let's get another one.
ELAINE: No, we're late as it is. I'll just take it off.
JERRY: No no come on really, get another one. It'll take a second.
ELAINE: Alright, alright.
(they walk back up to the counter)
ELAINE: Excuse me.
Man: Hey hey, I'm on line here.
ELAINE: No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a (quietly) hair on it.
CLERK: You have to take a number.
ELAINE: We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) you're gonna wait now?
JERRY: Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.
ELAINE: Well it was a little hair. I took it off.
JERRY: A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?
ELAINE: What if it's your hair?
JERRY: What if it's your hair?
ELAINE: (Wh-wh) What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.
JERRY: Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. (pretends to pull hair out)
ELAINE: Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.
JERRY: Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?
ELAINE: No I'm bringing cake! (looking worried and apprehensive)
[Liquor store]
GEORGE: All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Whoopee Whoa! Imagine if we didn't bring the wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT!
(George picks up the bottle of wine from the counter. George and Kramer start walking to the door)
KRAMER: (reading from the Penthouse Forum) "I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true…" (exits to street) " A few weeks ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor Linda was…"
GEORGE: L-Look at this?
KRAMER: Ahh.
GEORGE: Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No, no note. Can you believe this?
KRAMER: "…well of course I noticed it too with those cannibal breasts and pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out…." (turns the page)
[Still on street but much later -- it's night]
GEORGE: I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?
KRAMER: No, no I can't comprehend it?
GEORGE: I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're still basically very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?
KRAMER: Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.
GEORGE: So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.
KRAMER: Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other hand he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?
GEORGE: Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. Yeah this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?
KRAMER: How about Idi Amin, huh?
GEORGE: I'll tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!
KRAMER: Are those shoes comfortable?
GEORGE: No not really.
KRAMER: Cause they look comfortable.
GEORGE: I know that's why I bought `em but they're not comfortable.
[Royal Bakery]
ELAINE: Why couldn't we just take the hair off and go?
JERRY: No. That's out of the question.
ELAINE: Whhhy?
JERRY: Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
ELAINE: What happened?
JERRY: I'd rather not talk about it.
ELAINE: You can't tell me?
JERRY: All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.
(*Farina: A meal or flour obtained chiefly from cereals, nuts, potatoes or Indian Corn, and used as a breakfast food.)
ELAINE: You found a hair in your Farina?
JERRY: Yeah.
CLERK'S VOICE (off camera): 56
ELAINE: What happened?
JERRY: Well I started screaming, "There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina." Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running (In the background -- CLERK'S VOICE: 57) and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.
ELAINE: (quietly) Wow. Who's hair was it?
(In the background -- the Clerk is coughing)
JERRY: My mother's.
ELAINE: (quietly) Ahhhhh
CLERK: 58!
ELAINE: Ooo, That's us. (hits Jerry in the arm)
JERRY: Oh, good.
(Elaine and Jerry walk up to the counter. She sets the box on the counter with a thud)
ELAINE: You sold us a hair with a cake around it. We'd like another one.
CLERK: (coughing and coughing, getting really bad)
JERRY: Oh, that's lovely.
ELAINE: Ah,
JERRY: That's what you want to see, yeah. . . . Yeah, you want to trade your hair for some phlegm.
(coughing and coughing)
JERRY: Yeah that's a good deal -- you win the Pennant with that trade, hair for phlegm.
CLERK: Here you are. (hands Elaine the cake box)
ELAINE: Okay. Alright we got the cake now. Where is George and Kramer?
[on street outside Liquor Store]
(honking -- honk, honk honk honk, honk)
KRAMER: HEY DOUBLE-PARKER! (honk, honk) SHOW YOURSELF. (honk, honk) COME ON OUT, I'M FREEZING! (honk, honk)
GEORGE: We are really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
KRAMER: Why?
GEORGE: You know -- Elaine.
KRAMER: What about her?
GEORGE: . . . I'm a little scared of her.
KRAMER: You're scared of Elaine?
GEORGE: Yes!
KRAMER: Why?
GEORGE: Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late cause I bought a Panama hat -- she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it.
KRAMER: Hey, let's go inside the liquor store. I'm freezin in here.
GEORGE: Why didn't you just wear a heavier coat?
KRAMER: Because I wanted to look good for the party.
(they get out of the car and see a man and woman walking towards the double parked car . George goes right up to the man.)
GEORGE: Oh, Hey, hey, hey! That's great! That's very nice. You know we've been waiting twenty minutes for you people?! What do you think, you're Mussolini?!
MAN2: Back off *Puff Ball* it's not my car! (shoving George's shoulder, he turns and walks away)
GEORGE: I wasn't talking to you.
[Royal Bakery]
(Jerry and Elaine sit inside waiting for George and Kramer to show up)
ELAINE: Wait `til I get my hands on that George. I am gonna *pull* that big hood over his little head... tie the strings, and suffocate. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.
JERRY: Huh, wa?
ELAINE: What's the matter with you?
JERRY: I don't know, I don't feel so good.
ELAINE: What's wrong?
JERRY: My stomach, I , think it was that cookie.
ELAINE: The black and white?
JERRY: Yeah.
ELAINE: Not getting' along?
JERRY: I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there.
ELAINE: (mocking - in a dopey voice) "Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?"
JERRY: Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up.
ELAINE: Wait, what about your vomit streak?
JERRY: I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.
(A man with cane turns from the counter and puts the cane on Elaine's foot)
ELAINE: Oh, oh! Ooh my god. Oh!
MAN3: Sooory.
ELAINE: Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, LUNATIC!… (the man turns and walks away)
ELAINE: (con't) ...uh, Jerry, I think he broke my toe. (Jerry gets up) W-Where're you going?
JERRY: Fourteen years down the drain. (points and walks off -- to the bathroom)
[Liquor Store]
GEORGE: Do you think chickens have individual personalities?
KRAMER: (shivering) I don't know.
GEORGE: If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak, bak, baak, bak? Cause if they have individual personalities I'm not sure we should be eaten `em. What's the matter with you?
KRAMER: (shivering gibberish) Waj cha jia ja
CLERK: Can I help you guys with anything?
GEORGE: Oh, no no no -- We bought the wine here before, but now, you know we're bl-blocked in by some car double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out.
CLERK: Well wait outside. This isn't a hangout.
GEORGE: But my friend here has hypothermia.
KRAMER: (shivering) Hypothermia.
CLERK: All right guys, take it outside.
(George turns and knocks into a wine display -- breaking several bottles)
CLERK: You're paying for these.
(Krames slips on the wine and falls)
[Royal bakery]
(Elaine tending to her foot, Jerry emerges)
ELAINE: How was it?
JERRY: As good as it gets.
[Outside Liquor Store]
(Kramer and George standing outside freezing)
GEORGE: You know that coat was Gore-Tex. It's worth a hell of a lot more than that, cheap Chardonnay.
KRAMER: (shivering) You know I'm freezin. I'm definitely freezin. I can't stop shaking.
GEORGE: I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.
(Kramer grabs George's arm and motions towards a man headed for the double parked car. He has a large mustache and is wearing a long overcoat and a beret)
KRAMER: (quietly) L-l (look)
GEORGE: Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein. The dictator.
MAN4: I wouldn't walk around without a coat in this weather; you'll catch your death of cold. So long. (waves to George and Kramer as they wave back at him.)
[Royal bakery]
(Jerry sitting next to Elaine, who is tending to her injured foot)
CLERK: Can I get'ca anything else?
JERRY: Oh, no thanks.
CLERK: How about a nice box of "scram".
(George enters - Jerry nudges Elaine with his elbow and points at George)
GEORGE: S-s-somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He eh, had a British accent though.
(Elaine and Jerry stand up slowly)
GEORGE: What, what happened to you?
ELAINE: Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your...
JERRY: Hey, what happened to your coat? And what is the smell? Is-ya, What are you drunk?
GEORGE: I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
JERRY: What for?
GEORGE: I spilled some Chardonnay. So, what did you get?
(they start walking to the door, Elaine is limping and in some pain)
ELAINE: Cinnamon babka.
GEORGE: Cinnamon? Why didn't 'cha get chocolate?
(Elaine shoots a quick look at George)
JERRY: George!
[In the car]
(All four riding in silence, Kramer is still shivering)
[Apartment #7]
(Elaine knocks 3 times on the door. The door opens)
ELAINE: Here, here's your cake. (just about tosses it at the woman)
GEORGE: And your wine.
ELAINE: See ya'.
JERRY: See ya'.
(all four turn and walk off. The woman stands there looking confused, holding the wine and cake box.)
[Closing Monologue]
I heard a weather man say, that, 75% of your body heat is actually lost, through the top of the top of the head. Which sounds like you could go skiing naked if you got a good hat. But there's no hat that makes a statement quite like the hat with the flaps. The hat with the flaps (grabs the hat and holds it up), makes a statement that no, that no other, hat makes. This hat says to the world "I would rather have the heat in my skull than anything society could possibly offer." In fact I would say if you're on trial for serious crime and you lawyer recommends the insanity defense, this is the hat to wear. I mean your lawyer should really insist on it. He should just go "Your honor, (puts on the hat) The defense rests."
[Opening Monologue]
JERRY: I love these nature shows, I'll watch and kind of nature show, and it's amazing how you can always relate, to whatever they're talking about. You know like you're watching the African Dung Beetle and you're going "Boy, his life is a lot like mine." And you always root for whichever animal is the star of the show that week -- like if it's the antelope, and there's a lion chasing the antelope you go, "Run antelope Run! Use your Speed, Get away!" But the next week it's the lion, and then you go "Get the antelope, eat him, bite his head! -- Trap him, don't let him use his speed!"
[Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry is at the table and Elaine is on the phone)
ELAINE: (to the phone) Well did he bring it up in the meeting?
(Jerry picks up a yellow shirt and walks to Elaine)
JERRY: Elaine, see this T-shirt, six years I've had this T-shirt. It's my best one, I call him… Golden Boy.
(Jerry unfurls the shirt and holds it up for Elaine to see)
ELAINE: Yeah, I'm on the phone here.
JERRY: Golden Boy's always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry. Here... touch Golden Boy!
ELAINE: No thanks. (to the phone) Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.
JERRY: But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure.
ELAINE: Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight?
JERRY: No!!! The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him, you break his spirit!
(Elaine is suddenly excited)
ELAINE: (to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! that's fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye. (Elaine jumps up and dances around) Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!
JERRY: The guy who's in the gulag?!
ELAINE: Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working on it! Lippman and I are gonna go to the airport on Thursday and pick him up in a limousine!
JERRY: You wanna barrow Golden Boy!
ELAINE: Oh! (pushing Jerry) Do you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy!
JERRY: Hey ya know I read an unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the other day, did you know the original title for "War and Peace" was "War--What Is It Good For?"!
ELAINE: ... (looking at Jerry for a second then, mockingly nods her head back and forth) ....Ha ha ha ha.
JERRY: No, no… I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like the title and insisted that he change it to "War and Peace"!
ELAINE: But it's a line from that song!
JERRY: That's were they got it from!
ELAINE: Really?
JERRY: I'm not joking!
(George enters with a handful of mail, pauses, and takes a wide stance in a semi-dramatic fashion)
GEORGE: … You can't handle the truth! (he salutes) (imitating Jack Nicholson [a.k.a. Col. Nathan R. Jessep], from the 1992 movie A Few Good Men)
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: (still in Jack's voice) I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the truth! (he salutes)
ELAINE: What is this your mail? (She takes a magazine and starts flipping through it)
GEORGE: Yeah, I grabbed it on the way out, I don't want my mother reading it.
ELAINE: Oh! Your Alumni Magazine.
JERRY: Your mother reads your mail?
GEORGE: Yeah.
JERRY: What do you mean like post-cards an...?
GEORGE: No, anything.
JERRY: She doesn't open...?
GEORGE: She'll open!
JERRY: You've caught your mother opening envelopes!
GEORGE: Yes.
JERRY: What did she say?
GEORGE: I was curious! (imitating his mom's voice)
JERRY: Isn't that against the law?
GEORGE: Maybe I can get her locked up.
ELAINE: (gasp) Hey Jerry, you're in the Alumni magazine! Listen to this: Jerry Seinfeld has appeared on "David Letterman" and the "Tonight Show" and he did a pilot for NBC called "Jerry" ...that was not picked up. Georgie, how come there's not anything about you in here?
JERRY: He can't handle the truth!
ELAINE: All right… (slaps the magazine down on the counter) this is too much fun, I gotta get back to work. (heads for the door)
[Shot of Kramer from behind, walking in the hallway to his apartment door, he is getting his keys out and carrying a golf bag full of clubs over his shoulder]
KRAMER: (singing) Johnny Yuma was a rebel, Yeah! ...
(Kramer makes a wide turn towards his door to put the key in, and in the process, the golf bag knocks into Elaine as she leaves Jerry's apartment.)
KRAMER: Are you all right?
ELAINE: Yeah. (startled)
KRAMER: Unh.... Sorry.
ELAINE: It's OK. (starts walking down the hallway)
KRAMER: Yeah. Oh, here, wait wait (walks a few steps to catch up to her as she stops) Ah, maybe you could ah, use this (he searches through his jacket) Ah, here, it's a electronic organizer...
ELAINE: What?
KRAMER: Ah, Yeah. uh...
ELAINE: Wh..?
KRAMER: Yeah, here it is... yeah.
(Elaine Gasps)
KRAMER: You know, for phone numbers, addresses, keep appointments, everything.
ELAINE: Wow!
KRAMER: It's got an alarm that beeps!
ELAINE: Oh! I can't believe this, Kramer!
KRAMER: Yeah.
ELAINE: I've been wanting to get one of these things! Are you sure that...
(Kramer drops a piece of paper. He bends over to pick it up -- clubs slide down and golf balls drops everywhere)
ELAINE: ...Are you sure you can't use this thing?
KRAMER: No no no. I got all my appointments up here. (he points to his head)
ELAINE: Where'd you get this?
KRAMER: Well, the bank, I opened up a new account.
[Back inside Jerry's apartment - George comes out of the bathroom as Jerry, standing at the table, reads the paper]
GEORGE: Hey, did you see that whale thing on TV last night?
JERRY: No.
GEORGE: I am such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were showin' how they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, what a fish!
JERRY: It's a mammal.
GEORGE: Whatever. (George looks to the table) Hey new tape recorder?
JERRY: Yeah, got it from the bank.
(Kramer enters without his golf bag)
KRAMER: (overly excited) Hey (Claps hands one time)
JERRY: Hey.
GEORGE: Hey.
KRAMER: (still overly excited) Who wants to have some fun!
JERRY: I do.
GEORGE: I do.
KRAMER: (once again, overly excited) Now are you just sayin' you want to have fun or do you reallllly want to have fun?!
JERRY: I really wanna have fun.
GEORGE: I'm just sayin' I wanna have some fun.
KRAMER: Right now there six-hundred Titleists that I got from the driving range in the trunk of my car. Why don't we drive out to Rock-a-Way… and hit `em-----------(very over excited) into the ocean! Now picture this.... we find a nice sweet spot between the dunes, we take out our drivers, we tee up and (he makes a golf stroke), that ball goes sailing up into the sky holds there for a moment and then....... ..... gulp!
GEORGE: Come on. Ya wanna go get some lunch?
JERRY: Yeah, let me just stop by the cash machine and I'll meet you over at the coffee shop.
GEORGE: Yeah, I'm gonna get a paper.
(Kramer gets ready to make another imaginary swing)
GEORGE: Keep your head down.
KRAMER: Yeah! (Kramer takes a huge imaginary swing)
[At the ATM Jerry is getting some money -- there is a woman at the ATM to his right]
JERRY: (he hits a few keys and looks over at her) Cash advance... yes (hits a key) … no (he looks over again) balance inquiry... no (he looks again) receipt.... no (he looks again) processing... processing... (He opens the box, pulls out his money and then looks at the woman and says) I won!
(Jerry starts to walk away)
DIANE: Jerry?
JERRY: Yeah.
DIANE: It's Diane, Diane DeConn, from Queens college.
JERRY: Oh Diane.
DIANE: (laughing a little) How are you?
JERRY: Good, good.
DIANE: (sighs) How long has it been?
JERRY: Since college.
DIANE: Huh. I've been seeing you on TV you're doin' great.
JERRY: Yeah pluggin' along.
DIANE: You know I got the Alumni magazine. What ever happened to your friend George? I notice I never see his name in there.
JERRY: Well he's kind of modest.
DIANE: He was always such a goof-off. I mean did he ever get anywhere?
JERRY: Sure.
DIANE: Yeah? What field?
JERRY: Marine biology.
DIANE: George is a marine biologist?!
JERRY: Yeah, pretty damn good one, too!
DIANE: I can't believe it. I-I would never had thought…
JERRY: Yeah... he's specializing in whales. He's working on lowering the cholesterol level, in whales… all that blubber -- quite unhealthy. You know it's the largest mammal on earth but as George says "they don't have to be."
[In the coffee shop Jerry and George are sitting in the booth and talking]
GEORGE: Diane DeConn? You saw Diane DeConn!
JERRY: Something huh?
GEORGE: Ahh! How'd she look?
JERRY: She looked great.
GEORGE: Ahh! (closes his eyes and rolling his head back) Umh!
JERRY: She asked about you.
GEORGE: She asked about me? What did- What did she say?
JERRY: "How's George?"
GEORGE: George! She said George? She remembered my name. (loudly -- to a passing waitress and the rest of the restaurant) Diane DeConn remembered my name. She was the "it" girl!
JERRY: Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get in touch with you.
GEORGE: (pauses for a few seconds) …OK, I'm tellin' you right now - if your kiddin' around I'm not gonna be able to be your friend anymore. I'm serious about that. You got that.
JERRY: I got no problem with that.
GEORGE: Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this is a joke, if this is your idea of some cute little game… we're finished!
JERRY: Expect a call.
GEORGE: Oh my god he's not kidding. (exhale gasp)
JERRY: Now, I should tell you… that, at this point, she's under the impression that you're - a - ah…
GEORGE: A what?
JERRY: A marine biologist.
GEORGE: (pauses) A marine biologist?
JERRY: Yes.
GEORGE: Why am I a marine biologist?
JERRY: I may have mentioned it.
GEORGE: But I'm not a marine biologist!
JERRY: Yes I know that.
GEORGE: So?
JERRY: Why, you don't think it's a good job?
GEORGE: I didn't even know it was a job.
JERRY: Oh it's a fascinating field!
GEORGE: Well what if she calls me? What am I supposed to say?! (hand hits the table)
[Dusk -- In George's parent's house... George is sitting in a chair. He is talking to Diane on the phone]
GEORGE: Algae,… obviously plankton, hmhm. I don't know what else I could tell ya, ah, Oh I-I just got back from a trip to the Galapagos Islands, I was living with the turtles.
[Limo driving on the street -- then inside the limo: Elaine, Lippman, and Testikov are talkin']
LIPPMAN: We have got you in a very nice hotel, I-I don't know how you like to work, but ah, I can arrange for an office if you like.
TESTIKOV: (Russian accent) I work in hotel.
LIPPMAN: Oh.
TESTIKOV: … is better.
(Elaine gestures towards Testikov, she nods in agreement -- trying to tell Lippman, she quietly says he'll work at the hotel -- of course he just heard it directly from Testikov)
TESTIKOV: Away from all your little petty bickerings and interference.
LIPPMAN: You know, Tolstoy use to write in the village square. The faces inspired him.
TESTIKOV: (proudly) He did not need inspiration… God spoke through his pen. Hu Hu Hu (pounds his fist lightly on his heart)
ELAINE: Ohh, That is so true! (clutches her hands to her chest)
LIPPMAN: Yes.
ELAINE: Although one wonders if "War and Peace" would has been as highly acclaimed as it was, had it was published under it's original title "War---What Is It Good For?"
LIPPMAN: What?
ELAINE: Yeah. Mr. Lippman. It was *his mistress* who insisted that he call it…
LIPPMAN: Elaine…
[Background cars: Honk Honk]
ELAINE: "War and Peace."
LIPPMAN: Elaine…
ELAINE: "War--What Is It Good For." (sings) Absolutely nothin' HUH! Say it Again! ahehehehe
TESTIKOV: (quietly) Ahhuuh
ELAINE: (spoken to Testikov) that's a song …
LIPPMAN: It… (frustrated and trying to keep her from saying more)
ELAINE: …they-they took it from Tolstoy.
LIPPMAN: No. e-Elaine.
(Elaine's organizer starts beeping)
TESTIKOV: War--What Is It Good For?
LIPPMAN: It-no- it's just her sense of humor.
ELAINE: No it's not. That really is true.
TESTIKOV: What is that noise!
LIPPMAN: It's Not…
ELAINE: Yes it is…
LIPPMAN: No It's Not!!
TESTIKOV: That noise! …
LIPPMAN: it-it-it's her purse.
TESTIKOV: Where is that noise? It's traveling up my spine! Into my Brain!
ELAINE: Oh, I…
LIPPMAN: It's coming from your purse.
ELAINE: Oh… It must be my new organizer.
TESTIKOV: That noise! …
LIPPMAN: Yes…Turn it off.
ELAINE: Right, I think it's this…
LIPPMAN: No it's the Button. Elaine…
TESTIKOV: I can not stand it!
LIPPMAN: It's the button at the top, the top.
ELAINE: OK. I don't quite know…
TESTIKOV: Will you Turn it off!
LIPPMAN: The one at the top.
ELAINE: Yeah, I'm gonna work on that…
TESTIKOV: Aaach!
(Testikov grabs the organizer and throws it out the window of the limo)
LIPPMAN: Yeah… Ohoo.
[On the beach Kramer is getting ready to hit a ball. He takes a big swing and misses. He looks for the ball in the air and the realizes that it's still on the ground.]
[Jerry's apartment]
JERRY: I did it for you.
GEORGE: I don't know what'cha had to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing.
JERRY: You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.
GEORGE: Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am.
JERRY: Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing and…
GEORGE: Look, why couldn't you make me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I-I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I-I-I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. I mean maybe she just likes me for me.
(Kramer bangs into the room with his golf clubs)
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
KRAMER: Hey ya want these (He throws down the golf clubs -- kicks the bag hard) I don't want em!
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out there!
JERRY: Well what happened?
KRAMER: I have no concentration!
(Kramer starts to brush his hands at the back of his neck and scratch his body)
JERRY: What, what, what's wrong with you?
KRAMER: Sand, I can get rid of the sand. (he sits at the table, looking down his shirt) Look there's still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand in the pockets!
(He empties his pocket and a bunch of sand falls out)
JERRY: Hey come on, you're getting it all over the floor!
(Kramer gets sand in his eye, as he puts his hands to his eyes he falls over on to the floor. Then the phone rings -- George picks up the receiver and, without even looking, tosses it to Jerry)
JERRY: (to the phone) Hello… yeah… yes it is… really… ah, ah… Could you hold on a second? (to George and Kramer) Hey listen to this, some woman found an electronic organizer, my name was in it, she wants me to help her track down the owner.
GEORGE: How'd she find it?
JERRY: She's waking down the street and it hit her in the head!
[Monk's where Jerry and Corinne (the woman he was talking with on the phone) are sitting in the booth ]
CORINNE: So I am walkin' along, minding my own business when all off the sudden this thing comes flying out of nowhere and clonks me right on the head.
JERRY: Wow.
CORINNE: Yeah, So they took me to the hospital…
JERRY: Yeah…
CORINNE: …and they put me in this thing, that feels like a coffin, for forty-five minutes. Have you ever been in one of those things? You could go berserk in there!
JERRY: Well you have insurance...
CORINNE: I wish!
JERRY: Unbelievable!
CORINNE: Yeah.
(Organizer beeps)
JERRY: What is with this thing.
CORINNE: (hits the organizer) I don't know, it never shuts up. So anyway, you could see why I would be interested in finding this person.
JERRY: Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that.
(Organizer beeps again)
CORINNE: (hits the organizer, picks it up and hits it on to the table -- shouting) Stop it! Stop it!
JERRY: Let me have a look at this thing.
CORINNE: Ya know it was somebody told me they thought they saw that thing come out of a limousine.
JERRY: Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.
CORINNE: Boy am I lucky your name came up. I just pushed a button.
JERRY: I would like to know what my name's doin in this creep's organizer to begin with.
CORINNE: Yeah.
JERRY: Who do I know who would have even been in a limousine yesterday anyway. Uhh-O h-owow!
[Exterior of Jerry and Kramer's building, then in the hallway -- Elaine knocks on Kramer's door, he answers -- his right elbow is way up above his head and his arm is down his back as he is still itching cause of the sand]
KRAMER: Wha-- Oh, hey.
ELAINE: Hey, "great" organizer you gave me.
KRAMER: Oh, you liked it huh.
ELAINE: It wouldn't stop beeping, in the car so Testikov, through it out the window.
KRAMER: Oh. (continuing to itch and scratch from the sand)
ELAINE: I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer.
(flapping his shirt vigorusly to get the sand out)
ELAINE: What, what is it?
KRAMER: The sand, it's everywhere! (blows on his arm)
ELAINE: OK I'll see you later.
KRAMER: Yei-
(Kramer closes the door and Jerry walks up to his door)
JERRY: Oh, there you are!
ELAINE: There you are!
JERRY: So?
ELAINE: So?
JERRY: So what do you have to say for yourself?
ELAINE: So what do you have to say for yourself?
(Jerry unlocks the door and they both walk in and close the door)
JERRY: Why should I have anything for say for myself?
ELAINE: "War-- What is it good for?"!
JERRY: A-Ahahahahah. Who told you?
ELAINE: A-hu hu hu hu. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! Hellooo!
JERRY: You told Testikov, (Elaine nods) that Tolstoy wanted to name his book "War-- What Is IT Good For?"?
ELAINE: Uh-hu. And do you know what happened?
JERRY: Can I take a guess?
ELAINE: Oh, Please.
JERRY: Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?
(Elaine pushes Jerry)
ELAINE: What, how did you know that?
JERRY: Because I know who has it.
ELAINE: (gasps) How did you find it?
JERRY: Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met!
ELAINE: (gasps) Where is it, give it to me!
JERRY: I don't have it!
ELAINE: Why not.
JERRY: Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.
ELAINE: But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it!
JERRY: How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?
ELAINE: One million.
JERRY: Well that's a start.
[George and Diane are walking on the beach]
GEORGE: Then of course with evolution, the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today.
DIANE: Uh-Really?
GEORGE: Yeah, but if you still look closely you can see ah, a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu.
DIANE: Wow.
GEORGE: But enough about fish, huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know, ah… architecture. Huhu. (makes a wide gesture with his arms)
[At the hotel that Testikov is staying at]
JERRY: You know what room Testikov's in?
ELAINE: Yeah, 308. Oh, I'm crazy for doing this!
JERRY: Well, you want your organizer back don't you?
ELAINE: Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out?
JERRY: Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her!
ELAINE: Well, you're not Superman.
JERRY: Well you're not Lois Lane.
ELAINE: Oh. Listen, you got the tape-recorder.
JERRY: Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? (hands Elaine the tape recorder.)
ELAINE: Yeah I gotta get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the "New England Journal Of Medicine" I'm not gonna pay for it.
JERRY: Oh, here she comes.
(Corinne enters through the hotel's revolving door)
JERRY: Hi.
CORINNE: Hi.
JERRY: Elaine, this is Corinne.
CORINNE: Hello.
ELAINE: Hi, (sighs) you got the organizer?
(The organizer starts to beep as Corinne opens her coat to show the organizer in her inside coat pocket)
JERRY: All right lets go. We'll meet you back down here in ten minutes, hopefully with the money.
[At the beach George and Diane are still walking]
DIANE: Your parents must be so proud of you, George.
GEORGE: Oh, they're busting!
DIANE: Hmhm.
(There is a large crowd of men and women looking and pointing into the ocean)
DIANE: What are those people doing over there?
[Exterior shot of the hotel, then In Testikov's hotel room there are five quick knocks at the door. He holds the manuscript in his left arm. Leaning over a bit, and with his right hand, opens the door slightly to see who is waiting -- it is Jerry and Elaine. Then he opens the door wide]
TESTIKOV: (In a loud and cranky voice) What, Come in - come in - Come in Miss Benes! That is if you can spare a minute from your busy schedule! And you bring guest for my entertainment?
(Testikov goes to get a drink while Elaine is talking -- his back to them as he downs the full drink)
ELAINE: Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. Um, he accompanied me, ya know (clears throat), single women in a big city can be dangerous, so…
JERRY: Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- Zip, I'm gone. (makes a running motion with both arms and his right foot)
TESTIKOV: Yeah, Yeah. The sneakers. All the Americans with the sneakers. Always running from something. Ya ya, well Sit, stop running, Ehh. two minutes, I give you latest manuscript!
(They both sit down and Jerry picks out a very large book from the coffee table)
JERRY: Oh! Rimsky -- great great book if I may say so sir. I almost read the whole thing.
ELAINE: Hmm. (she nods in agreement)
[Corinne is standing in the hotel lobby smoking while the organizer is still beeping]
CORINNE: What!
HOTEL CLERK: If you can't thing off, I'll have to ask you to leave.
CORINNE: I'm waitin for two people! (takes a drag on the cigarette)
HOTEL CLERK: Well you can wait for them outside.
CORINNE: Yeah, (she blows smoke out as she speaks -- it rises as in front of her) I guess I'd better. I wouldn't want to take any attention away from the hookers!
HOTEL CLERK: All right, All right. Out, Out.
CORINNE: Whatever you say, Cro..w-well!
(she exits through the hotel's revolving door, the organizer continues to beep)
[On the beach George and Diane are standing with the crowd]
DIANE: What's going on over here?
WOMAN AT BEACH: There is a beached whale, she's dying.
VOICE: Is anyone here a marine biologist?
(Diane looks at George as he turns slowly towards her realizing the irony of the situation he is in.)
[Upwards view of the exterior of the hotel, then in Testikov's room]
TESTIKOV: Here is latest draft. I see you next week. Same time, same day. (smacks the manuscript into Elaine's hand) On time please.
ELAINE: (quietly) OK.
JERRY: It was nice meeting you…
TESTIKOV: Aah.
JERRY: … you're a real pleasure. (Jerry is being sarcastic)
TESTIKOV: Ya ya. (wipes his nose with a handkerchief)
(Elaine and Jerry take a few steps towards the door, as Jerry turns to her and motions with his hand to ask Testikov about the organizer incident. They stop and turn back.)
ELAINE: Uh-Oh-ah, by the way Mr. Testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window?
TESTIKOV: (quietly) yes. How could I forget? heehe.
ELAINE: ( laughs) Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head.
JERRY: Right in the head! (leans in and points at Testikov)
(The tape-recorder in Elaine's purse starts to squeak)
ELAINE: Boing! Hehe hehe. (makes a hand gesture to her forehead and away)
(The tape-recorder is squeaking much louder as it rewinds)
TESTIKOV: (Shouting) What is that noise!
ELAINE: Oh that's nothing. Um and anyway um…
TESTIKOV: What's going on Huh! (he grabs Elaine's purse) That Noise!…
ELAINE: No, No that's my purse!
TESTIKOV: That Noise!
(Jerry watches the action as he rubs his hand on the top of his head)
ELAINE: No, get-get off my purse!
TESTIKOV: Agh, it's recorder!
(He pulls out the recorder)
ELAINE: No that's… Radio!
TESTIKOV: Ha! (he clicks the player off) You are spying on me!
(Elaine bites her finger as Testikov throws the recorder out of the hotel window -- from below, we see the recorder falling -- with blue sky above it. The sound of the tape playing in fast motion as it falls (odd, because Testikov had turned the player off. --
[Corinne is standing outside of the hotel and looks up to see the tape-recorder falling towards her. A sound indicates that it hits her in the head]
[Newman is strolling down the street whistling. Kramer is standing at his open window, knocking his boot on the window sill trying to get the sand out but he drops it. A high pitched sound and a shot of the falling boot as Newman stops and looks up -- and he yells as the boot is obviously about to hit him in the head]
[At the beach everyone is yelling at George]
CROWD: Come on! Save the whale! You gotta do it!
DIANE: Save the whale George... for me.
(George turns and slowly walks towards the ocean with a determined look. He takes off his hat and throws it down. He walks into the ocean -- his pant legs are rolled up)
[At the coffee shop Jerry and Kramer are awaiting the story]
GEORGE: So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment … I was a Marine Biologist!
(Elaine enters and sits down)
ELAINE: George I've just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable!
GEORGE: I know I was just telling them the story.
KRAMER: Well come on George, finish the story.
GEORGE: The sea was angry that day my friends… like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli!
(Jerry gives Kramer a "What the --" glance)
GEORGE: I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, "Easy big fella!" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its' breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!
JERRY: Mammal.
GEORGE: Whatever.
KRAMER: Well then, what did you do next?
GEORGE: Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, (ELAINE: gasps quietly Ahhhh) face to face with the blow-hole. I-I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there… so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction!
(George reaches into his inside jacket pocket and dramatically pulls something out in his clenched fist -- holding it up in the air for a second, then displays a golf ball holding it in mid air for the remaining 28 seconds of the scene)
(Elaine looks on, mouth wide open in amazement. Jerry turns and looks at Kramer also in amazement and George, while staring at Kramer, holds out the ball in the air… Kramer sits quietly, squirming -- and it's 21 seconds until Kramer speaks)
KRAMER: What is that a Titleist?
GEORGE: (Silently squinches his mouth and nods at Kramer)
KRAMER: A hole in one eh.
[still in the coffee shop]
JERRY: Well the-the crowd must have gone wild!
GEORGE: Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me…
KRAMER: (quietly) Um-hm.
GEORGE: …kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist.
JERRY: Wow! What'd she say?
GEORGE: Told me to "Go to hell!" and I took the bus home.
(George stuffs the golf ball in his shirt pocket)
JERRY: All right lets go.
(Jerry, Elaine and George all get up from the booth -- Kramer takes the last four spoonfuls of food from his bowl and wipes his mouth with a napkin before getting up.)
ELAINE: What, are you in a bad mood?
JERRY: Ahhh… got my laundry back.
ELAINE: Ohhh! Golden Boy?
JERRY: He didn't make it.
ELAINE: I'm sorry. (pats him on the arm)
JERRY: Yea. (pulls at the t-shirt) This is Golden Boy's son… Baby Blue.
(Elaine cocks her head a bit -- then she and Jerry turn and exit.)
KRAMER: (to George) What's with you?
GEORGE: Sand. It's everywhere
KRAMER: Yep.
[Opening Monologue]
JERRY: Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination? You couldn't possibly visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life size snotty puppet. I guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. That's the end of the line for a mannequin. "What ever happened to Bob?" "Have you seen that new Volvo commercial? He's got a bulls eye right in his face." Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, I guess these are the two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves. Well dressed or getting killed. I'm sure there is some pro-mannequin organization that doesn't even like you to use the term mannequin. "Hey they're not mannequins, they're the life deprived."
[Monk's coffee shop, evening]
(Jerry and his date, Audrey, are sitting at a booth having dinner)
AUDREY: Hum! That was really good!
JERRY: Yeah. are you full?
AUDREY: Oh no, I've had just enough.
(Waitress brings dessert)
JERRY: Ah, here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) Mmm, delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some.
AUDREY: No thanks.
JERRY: You're not gonna have any?
AUDREY: No (with a disgusted face)
JERRY: Do you not like apple pie?
AUDREY: No, it's not that.
JERRY: Well, at least taste it.
AUDREY: No (a resolute "no")
JERRY: You won't even taste it?
AUDREY: No.
JERRY: Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing "no") A little taste! (still shaking) Come on. (still shaking)
(scene ends)
[Jerry's appartment, the next day]
(Jerry and George)
JERRY: She wouldn't so much as taste it.
GEORGE: Did she say why?
JERRY: No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey)
GEORGE: Maybe she's diabetic.
JERRY: No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.
GEORGE: Maybe you said something that offended her.
JERRY: The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.
GEORGE: Like at the airport? (getting excited)
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: That's a great idea!!!
JERRY: Tell me about it!
GEORGE: We could be zipping all over the place.
JERRY: They could at least try it.
GEORGE: They never try anything.
JERRY: What's the harm?
GEORGE: No harm!
(Elaine enters)
JERRY: (still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.
ELAINE: Who wouldn't taste a pie?
JERRY: Audrey.
ELAINE: Dump her.
JERRY: Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???
ELAINE: (piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.
JERRY: You did?
ELAINE: He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.
GEORGE: Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing?
ELAINE: I got a pebble.
JERRY: Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?
ELAINE: What the hell does that mean?
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. (imitating a mannequin posture)
ELAINE: What? Why?
KRAMER: Do it. Do it. This.
ELAINE: Like... (doing it) Like this?
KRAMER: Oh yeah! It's you!
ELAINE: What's me?
KRAMER: (to the gang) There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.
ELAINE: Get out!
KRAMER: It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.
GEORGE: Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?
KRAMER: Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah...
JERRY: (to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? (wondering what the hell's Kramer doing)
KRAMER: It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it.
GEORGE: Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there?
KRAMER: Real Boss!
ELAINE: I'm going down there.
GEORGE: I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday.
ELAINE: (grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go.
GEORGE: All right. All right. (They both leave)
KRAMER: (leaving too, with the spatula) Are you gonna need this?
JERRY: Keep it. (implied: please)
(scene ends)
[Rinitze]
(George and Elaine stares at the mannequin)
ELAINE: It looks exactly like me.
GEORGE: It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.
ELAINE: What's going on here? How do you think this happened?
GEORGE: Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?
ELAINE: You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?
(the saleswoman approaches George as he's trying the suit)
SALESWOMAN: (european accent) You are perfect for that suit.
GEORGE: You think so?
ELAINE: (to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from?
SALESWOMAN: I don't know.
GEORGE: You really think this looks O.K. on me?
SALESWOMAN: Fabulous. Perfect fit. And it's the last one we have.
ELAINE: I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?
SALESWOMAN: I told you, I don't know.
ELAINE: (irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?
SALESWOMAN: Why?
ELAINE: Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.
(saleswoman rolls her eyes at George about Elaine)
ELAINE: (upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you.
SALESWOMAN: I think maybe you're flattering yourself. That mannquein is wearing a twelve hundred dollar Gaultier dress.
(George is looking at himself in the mirror and doesn't care about their dispute)
ELAINE: What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.
(Elaine leaves and waits outside)
SALESWOMAN: What is her problem?
GEORGE: Ah, Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) Is this the price tag?
SALESWOMAN: Yes.
GEORGE: Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit)
SALESWOMAN: I'll tell you a little secret. We're having an unadvertised sale starting Friday, that suit will be half-price.
GEORGE: So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?
SALESWOMAN: Oh, I'm afraid I could't do that. It wouldn't be fair to the other customers.
GEORGE: Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack)
(scene ends)
[Monk's]
(Jerry, Elaine and Kramer at a booth)
ELAINE: So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.
KRAMER: Well, how did they get your face?
ELAINE: I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello?
JERRY: (Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.
WOMAN 1: That's right.
JERRY: And you waved it away.
WOMAN 2: Right.
JERRY: Did you give her a reason?
WOMAN 2: Yes, I was full.
JERRY: You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.
WOMAN 2: No, I'm not a psycho.
JERRY: Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is.
ELAINE: We certainly have.
KRAMER: Hey, Elaine scratch my back.
ELAINE: No way!
KRAMER: Come on, one lap around.
ELAINE: No.
KRAMER: It will be a funky adventure.
ELAINE: Kramer, forget it.
KRAMER: Jerry, how about you?
JERRY: I think you know my policy.
KRAMER: I'm going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to the cashier)
ELAINE: I thought George was meeting us here?
JERRY: No he's going downtown to guard the suit.
ELAINE: He's guarding a suit?
OLIVE: (the cashier; to Kramer) Do you need some help with that itch?
KRAMER: Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa.
OLIVE: Turn around.
KRAMER: Oh, all right. (Olive scratches, Kramer enjoys, Elaine and Jerry watch.)
(scene ends)
[Rinitze]
SALESWOMAN: (makes a guy trying the suit) It fits you perfectly.
BOB: You think so? (she nods and walks away)
GEORGE: (outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you?
BOB: I'm buying the suit.
GEORGE: No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy)
BOB: Excuse me, do you work here?
GEORGE: (leaving the european accent) No. (laughs)
BOB: Then what the hell business is it of yours?
GEORGE: Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.
BOB: Really?
GEORGE: Yea Yea Yea
BOB: This Monday?
GEORGE: Yes. Now take off those pants.
SALESWOMAN: Actually, the unadvertised sale starts on Friday.
BOB: Friday? Thanks. (Gives a dirty look at George and leaves)
GEORGE: (to the saleswoman) You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.
(she starts undressing mannequin Elaine, and George acts like he's really seeing Elaine naked)
(scene ends)
[Poppie's restaurant]
(Jerry and Audrey are sitting at a table, and Jerry looks at the menu)
JERRY: I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?
AUDREY: Everything is delicious.
JERRY: You've tasted them?
AUDREY: Um-hmm, I think almost all of them.
JERRY: Oh I see they have apple pie.
AUDREY: Mmm-hmm.
JERRY: You've had the apple pie?
AUDREY: Many times.
JERRY: Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.
AUDREY: Can we drop this?
JERRY: (like a frustrated child) Why can't I know?
(Poppie comes to the table)
AUDREY: Ah! Poppie.
POPPIE: Sweetheart, hello.
AUDREY: Poppie, this is Jerry.
POPPIE: Welcome (shakes Jerry's hand)
JERRY: Hello Poppie.
POPPIE: Don't fill up on the bread. I'm making you a very special dinner. Very special. (he leaves)
JERRY: The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves)
[Poppie's Restaurant: Bathroom]
(Jerry and Poppie in the bathroom. Jerry washes his hands while Poppie flushes and gets out of the stall)
POPPIE: Ah, Jerry! Tonight you in for a real treat. I'm personnaly going to prepare the dinner for you and my Audrey.
(He zips up and leaves without washing his hands. Jerry notices it very shocked)
(Poppie's Restaurant]
(back at the table with Audrey, Jerry can see Poppie in the kitchen with his hands in the dough, making dinner)
AUDREY: Jerry are you OK?
JERRY: Huh?
AUDREY: Is anything wrong?
JERRY: No, Nothing.
AUDREY: You look like you've seen a ghost.
(Jerry can't talk and he's staring at Poppie's hands. Poppie smiles and winks at him)

OLIVE: (to another cashier) I'll see you tomorrow.

(Poppie serves dinner)
POPPIE: Here it is.
AUDREY: Wait till you taste this. (she eats) Poppie, this is perfect.

[Jerry's appartment]
(Jerry and George eating cereal sitting on the couch)
JERRY: So she tought I did it to get back at her
GEORGE: Why didn't you just tell her?
JERRY: I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.
GEORGE: How could he not have washed?
JERRY: Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something.
GEORGE: Yeah, just like I do.
JERRY: You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught.
GEORGE: Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it?
JERRY: We haven't spoken.
(Kramer enters holding the spatula)
KRAMER: Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. (Jerry throws out the spatula)
GEORGE: Olive?
KRAMER: Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks.
GEORGE: Oh.
KRAMER: You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.
GEORGE: I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes.
KRAMER: Is that Elaine mannequin still there?
GEORGE: Yeah.
KRAMER: Yeah.
GEORGE: The last time I saw her, she was naked.
JERRY: Yeah, and Poppie's got problems...
(scene ends)
[Rinitze]
(The saleswoman unlock the door's entrance where Bob is waiting. He rushes inside and George enters after him slowly and confident. Bob can't find the suit on the rack. George walks to a different rack.)
BOB: Where is it? Where is it?
GEORGE: (George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well, look at this. (innocently) This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.
BOB: You bastard! You hid the suit.
GEORGE: Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it.
BOB: I hope you rot in that suit. Look I'm gonna get you for this. I don't know how, but I'm gonna get you. You are going to pay!
GEORGE: Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.
(scene ends)
[Monks]
(Jerry and Elaine at a booth)
ELAINE: So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.
JERRY: Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested)
ELAINE: There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.
JERRY: (very disinterested) Hum... ok, what else you got?
ELAINE: OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.
JERRY: Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?
ELAINE: Because you have an attitude.
(George enters wearing his new suit, parading and snapping his fingers)
JERRY and ELAINE: Oh!
JERRY: Georgio! Nice duds!
GEORGE: You're telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) So, what do you think?
JERRY: Did you hear something?
ELAINE: Yeah, like a swoosh.
JERRY: Yeah.
ELAINE: (feels the fabric) It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.
(George walks back and forth to verify and it swooshes again)
GEORGE: I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour!
JERRY: So what? What would they care?
GEORGE: This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.
JERRY: So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?
GEORGE: Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?
JERRY: You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.
(Kramer comes back from the bathroom)
KRAMER: Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.
JERRY: Audrey?
KRAMER: Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.
JERRY: Was it apple?
KRAMER: What else?
JERRY: This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!
(a stranger stops and looks at Elaine)
STRANGER: Do I know you?
ELAINE: Hmm... No you don't.
STRANGER: Yeah! You were wearing a G-string and one of those bras with points.
ELAINE: The mannequin!
JERRY: Oh, I got to see this thing.
(scene ends)
[Rinitze]
(Jerry and Elaine enter and see the mannequin getting spanked by another mannequin)
JERRY: Boy, the resemblance is uncanny.
(Elaine goes to the saleswoman)
ELAINE: You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!
SALESWOMAN: It's our store and our mannequin, we can do whatever we want with it.
ELAINE: No! You take that mannequin down right now, or I'm pressing charges. (Jerry goes along) Yes, this is my attorney.
SALESWOMAN: (to Jerry) Yeah? What law am I breaking?
JERRY: Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,
ELAINE: Uh-huh
JERRY: The Charlie Macarthy hearings.
ELAINE: Uh-huh. Are you taking this down?
SALESWOMAN: I'm getting the manager. (she leaves)
ELAINE: Jerry get the car. (she's getting the mannequin)
JERRY: What are you doing?
ELAINE: Just get the car!
JERRY: Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.
(They get out with the mannequin)
(scene ends)
[Jerry's car]
(Jerry and Elaine are sitting in the car with the mannequin between them. Jerry looks at the two Elaines beside him.)
JERRY: I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright, I'm dropping you off at work, right?
ELAINE: Where are you going?
JERRY: Poppie's
(scene ends)
[a restaurant]
(George with MacKenzie and two other businessmen are walking to a table)
MACKENZIE: Thanks for meeting me down here George. My office is out of control, (George's pants are making noise) phones ringing, people running in and out. (MacKenzie stops talking and walking, George too) Did you hear something?
GEORGE: No, I didn't hear anything.
MACKENZIE: Huh, that's strange. (they start walking again) It's quieter here. We can concentrate without people wooshing around... (he stops again, George too) That sound again. Sure you didn't hear anything?
GEORGE: No, can't say as I did.
MACKENZIE: Kind of like a... rustling.
GEORGE: Could be the leaves...
(scene ends)
[Poppie's]
(Audrey talks to a client on the phone)
AUDREY: That's right. Poppie's on 77th. Ok we'll see you at 8:00. Bye-bye.
JERRY: Hello.
AUDREY: What are you doing here?
JERRY: So how was the pie?
AUDREY: What pie?
JERRY: The apple pie you had today at Monks
AUDREY: I'm very busy here.
JERRY: Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it.
AUDREY: You better not let Poppie see you here.
(a man in a coat, a Health Inspector, comes to Audrey)
HEALTH INSPECTOR: All right, I'm looking for someone named Poppie.
AUDREY: Uh, who are you?
HEALTH INSPECTOR: Board of health, we've had several complaints.
JERRY: Oh, about the... uh (Jerry pretend to wash his hands)
HEALTH INSPECTOR: Are you Poppie?
POPPIE: I'm Poppie.
HEALTH INSPECTOR: I think you'd better come with me.
POPPIE: What's the problem?
(Poppie leaves with the Health Inspector)
AUDREY: What do they want from Poppie?
JERRY: Well, Poppie's a little sloppy.
(scene ends)
[at the restaurant with MacKenzie]
(everybody's laughing at the table)
MACKENZIE: You taught I'd care about your pants wooshing?
GEORGE: I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.
MACKENZIE: No, no, no. He got fired because he wasn't a team player. That's something we don't joke about at MacKenzie. You'll find we're team here George. We don't tolerate dissent. If you want to go your own way, you're in the wrong place.
GEORGE: No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.
(The waiter brings dessert)
WAITER: Chocolate cream pie. Compliments of the house.
MACKENZIE: Oh! Hope you saved room for dessert.
WAITER: (to George) The chef said that he made it special for you.
GEORGE: Oh... (George looks around and sees the chef hiding behind a plant: it's Bob!)
MACKENZIE: Mmm.. Best pie I've ever tasted. Take a bite George. (George shakes his head doing "no") Well, take a bite. It's delicious. (still shaking) I insist. (still shaking)
BUSINESSMAN: If you're one of us, you'll take a bite.
(still shaking)

[Monk's]
(evening, George, Jerry and Kramer at a booth, Olive at the cash)
JERRY: So you didn't get the job.
GEORGE: No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.
JERRY: Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something.
KRAMER: What am I supposed to say?
JERRY: Tell her you lost your itch.
GEORGE: What happened to your itch?
KRAMER: I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.
JERRY: Well you should tell her.
KRAMER: I'll let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to Olive) Well, hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramer's back) No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.
OLIVE: What?
KRAMER: Uh, well, there's someone else.
OLIVE: Someone else?
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, yeah...
OLIVE: Who is she?
KRAMER: Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin in Jerry's car)
OLIVE: her?
KRAMER: Yeah, there she is. That's my gal.
OLIVE: You're a liar. I've seen her in here before. She's not your girlfriend.
KRAMER: Now Olive, look, I'm sorry.
OLIVE: Why is she wearing her underwear?
KRAMER: Well, it's the style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.
(Kramer gets into Jerry's car and starts making out with the mannequin while Olive is looking through the window. But it doesn't work quite as good as Kramer was hoping cause the mannequin's hand falls out from the arm)
GEORGE: Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?
JERRY: No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.
(Elaine enters and sit with Jerry and George. Olive is looking at her, confused.)
ELAINE: You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who was shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming from?
(scene ends)
[The building where Ricky works. Ricky's the guy in "The Cigar Store Indian" who made a bouquet for Elaine from Frank's TV guide.]
RICKY'S BOSS: Ricky, we've been getting a tremendous response to your TR-6 mannequin.
RICKY: TR-6? I prefer to think of her as... Elaine.
[Setting: Comedy Club]
Opening Monolog: The bus is the single stupidest, fattest, slowest, most despised vehicle on the road. Isn't it? You ever notice when you get behind the bus, people in your car go 'what are you doing? get away, come on.' The back of the bus is like an eclipse isn't it? people are just like 'the sun, where's the sun?' It's like this huge metal ass taking up the whole wind shield of your car. When it pulls out it even sounds like a fat uncle trying to get out of a sofa. (acts like he is trying to get out of a car and makes the sound of a bus/guy starting to get going)
(scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry and George on a Bus]
GEORGE: It's just not good, it's not good.
JERRY: It's not good.
GEORGE: I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers.
JERRY: Well at breakfast everybody reads.
GEORGE: No. Lunch we read, dinner we read.
JERRY: You read during lunch?
GEORGE: Ya
JERRY: Oh, well.
GEORGE: There's nothing to talk about.
JERRY: Ya, what's there to talk about.
GEORGE: Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.
JERRY: Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?
GEORGE: She knows there is nothing to talk about.
JERRY: At least you'll be talking.
GEORGE: Oh shut up.
(Al comes onto the bus)
AL: Hey, look who's here.
JERRY: Hey, Al.
GEORGE: Hey, Al. How's it going?
AL: (extremely happy) Deeply in love. We have soo many things to talk about. Sometimes we'll talk all night, till the sun comes up (pauses in his happiness; to George) so how about you?
GEORGE: Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower.
AL: Great girl.
GEORGE: We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.
JERRY: Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.
AL: (to Jerry) Oh did you hear about Fulton?
JERRY: Ya.
AL: I went by the hospital to see him a few days ago (looking at Jerry) think he'd really like you to come visit.
JERRY: Me?
AL: Ya, he said he could use a good laugh.
GEORGE: What about me?
AL: (to George) He didn't mention you. (Looks toward the front of the bus) This is my stop. Uh see ya.
GEORGE: Ya
JERRY: Ya, see ya.
(Al leaves)
GEORGE: Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn't say anything at all.
JERRY: (points to George) Ya.
(Scene Ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry and George enter the apartment)
GEORGE: I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.
JERRY: Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me.
GEORGE: Na no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. I..I make em feel worse.
JERRY: Oh, stop it.
GEORGE: Ya and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care?
JERRY: So you're not gonna come?
GEORGE: No but say hello for me.
(Kramer and Mickey enter)
KRAMER: Hey!
JERRY: Hey! Hey Mick.
MICKEY: Hey Jerry.
KRAMER: What's doing?
JERRY: Nothing, what's doing with you?
KRAMER: Same old, same old.
JERRY: George this is Mickey.
GEORGE: Hi, nice to meet you.
(George and Mickey shake hands)
MICKEY: Pleasure.
JERRY: How's work going you guys?
MICKEY: Lets not even talk about it.
GEORGE: (to Kramer) You got a job?
KRAMER: Ya, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on 'All My Children.' Mickey, he's a stand-in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kids father.
MICKEY: (to Jerry then both Jerry and George) But I got a big problem. The kid I stand in for, he's growing. He was four feet last month, now he's like four-two and a half. He shot up two and a half inches. I can do four-two, four-three is a stretch, any higher than that and I'm gonna be out on my ass doing that para-legal crap.
JERRY: How do you stop a kid from growing?
KRAMER: (to Mickey) I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.
MICKEY: I offered him cigarettes, (to Jerry and George) but his stupid mother is hanging around. She won't let him have any.
KRAMER: (to Mickey) What about lifts?
MICKEY: (to Kramer) Out of the question.
GEORGE: (to Mickey) Can't you just switch with another Midget?
(Mickey grabs the counter with rage on his face, Jerry does a form of gulp)
MICKEY: (turns and moves up to George, points his finger at him) It's little people, you got that?
KRAMER: Easy Mickey, easy.
GEORGE: Yap..
KRAMER: Alright we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing?
JERRY: I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton.
KRAMER: (on his way to the door) Oh, oh well say hello for me.
(Kramer and Mickey leave Jerry's apartment and enter the hallway)
KRAMER: Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes.
MICKEY: Lifts?! Look Kramer you don't understand, this kind of thing is just not done.
KRAMER: You wanna keep your job don't you?
MICKEY: Ya but..
(Kramer interrupts him)
KRAMER: YAH! No Buts
MICKEY: Kramer
(Kramer interrupts again)
KRAMER: (with his hand in Mickey's face) YAAAAAH!

(Fulton lying in the Hospital Bed, Jerry Enters)
JERRY: Hey, woahoh Fulton. It's me.
FULTON: Hey Jerry, good to see ya. I could really use a good laugh.
JERRY: Who couldn't.
FULTON: I haven't cracked a smile in months.
JERRY: Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.
FULTON: It's a fine time.
JERRY: Oh, alright ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....

(George and Daphne sitting in a booth reading the paper)
GEORGE: (sets down his paper) So how were the eggs?
DAPHNE: Eggs are eggs.
GEORGE: (Not amused with her answer) Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. (laughs; Daphne goes back to reading her paper) By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. (pauses) Listen Dophne
DAPHNE: (correcting George) Daphne.
GEORGE: Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult...
DAPHNE: (interrupts and hurriedly puts down her paper) Oh, I forgot to tell you. Al Netchie called me today.
GEORGE: Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?
DAPHNE: He told me not to get involved with you.
GEORGE: What?
DAPHNE: Ya, he said you could never make a commitment to any one and you'd just wind up (reaches out and lightly slaps George's hand) hurting me.
GEORGE: He said that? (Daphne shacks her head) What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.
DAPHNE: Is it true?
GEORGE: Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me.

MICKEY: (tugs on Kramer's coat) Don't go Daddy, don't...go.
KRAMER: Now listen Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much. But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.

MICKEY: Ah! (pauses for the hug) Alright (Kramer still holding on) Alright! Kramer! (pushes Kramer off him)
DIRECTOR: Ok everybody that's lunch... one hour.
(The director pauses and looks at Mickey as if something is different)
KRAMER: How do those lifts feel?
MICKEY: Quiet.
TAMMY: Hi guys.
MICKEY: Hey Tammy.
TAMMY: Hey, you look different. Have you been working out?
MICKEY: (looks at Kramer) Not that I know of.
TAMMY: Well whatever it is you're doing, keep doing it you look great.

MICKEY: You don't, you got the same ugly mug since the day I met ya.
JOHNNY: I don't know what it is, but I'll find out. (walking away) I'll find out.

PHIL: Hey Jerry.
JERRY: Hey Phil how you doing?
PHIL: You look terrific.
JERRY: I got my health.
PHIL: Well, that's the most important thing. (to Fulton) Hey how ya doing Fulton! Octane, Butane, Nitrane! (Fulton looks at him still stone faced and not amused. To Jerry) How's he doing?

(Buzzer)
JERRY: I told it. (Answers the buzzer) Ya?
GEORGE: (on the speaker) Ya
JERRY: Ya. (hits the button, opens the door. To Elaine) Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys.
ELAINE: Do I know him?
JERRY: No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.
ELAINE: If you were a woman would you go out with him?
JERRY: If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.
ELAINE: (laughs) Ya, I bet you would. Alright, give him my number.
JERRY: Alright.
(George Enters)
GEORGE: This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie, that pimple. Tells Daphne, not get this 'Not to get involved with me.'
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: Ya. That's what she told me.
ELAINE: Why?
GEORGE: Because he's afraid she's gonna get hurt.
ELAINE: Is she?
GEORGE: Of course.
ELAINE: So?
GEORGE: Wa.. He doesn't have to tell her.
ELAINE: Maybe he likes her.
GEORGE: Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me.
JERRY: So what are you gonna do?
GEORGE: Well I can't break up with her now.
JERRY: Why?
GEORGE: Because he said I was going to.
ELAINE: So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?
GEORGE: Yes, I am.
JERRY: Ya, I could see that.
GEORGE: I don't see any way around it.
JERRY: No, me either.
GEORGE: What choice do I have?
JERRY: None.

(Scene Ends)
[Setting: Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry and Kramer)
JERRY: Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.
KRAMER: Did you tell him the Packyderm story?
JERRY: (yelling) Yes I told him the Packyderm story!
KRAMER: Maybe I outta go over there.
JERRY: Towards what end?
KRAMER: I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, the doctors were amazed at his recovery.
(Knocking on the Door)
(Jerry and Kramer walk over to it, Kramer opens it to reveal Mickey)
KRAMER: Hey.

MICKEY: (to Kramer) Johnny Vigiano went through my locker.
KRAMER: YAOH!
MICKEY: (slamming the door) That little Bastard! He saw the lifts in my shoes. He knows I'm heightening. (to Kramer) This never would have happened if you hadn't pushed me to get those things. I told you.
KRAMER: Hey, nobody put a gun to your head.
MICKEY: Ya well just keep out of my business you big ape. (pushes Kramer)
KRAMER: Who you calling big ape? (pushes Mickey back)
MICKEY: You (grabs Kramer)

JERRY: (starts pulling them apart) Alright break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells)
KRAMER: (pacing back and forth) Ya.
JERRY; Behave yourselves.
MICKEY: I'm sorry Kramer.
KRAMER: No no it's alright, it's alright. You're stressed Oout!
JERRY: (to Mickey) Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?
MICKEY: Oh, he's always been jealous of me. I always get to stand in for the bigger stars; The Cosby Kids, Ricky Schroder, Macaulay Culkin.
KRAMER: (whistles) What's he like huh?
MICKEY: He's a good kid.
KRAMER: Ya?
JERRY: So what does he care if you put lifts in?
MICKEY: You don't understand. There's an unwritten code about this kind of thing. I could be ostracized. I remember when I was a kid, some guy tried to heighten. He lost his job, lost his friends, Everything. Oh, I knew I was crazy to try this kind of thing, but I was so desperate. (pauses laying on the couch; jumps up) What is this kid taking anyway? Hormones? Steroids? Would you tell me!?

[Setting: George's car outside Daphne's place]
DAPHNE: George, tomorrow's Sunday. We could sleep late, and get the paper and half breakfast and spend the morning together, go for a long walk, maybe do a little shopping, have lunch...
GEORGE: (interrupts her) You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.
DAPHNE: Why not?
GEORGE: I, I really should go home. Ya.. actually I'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow (short laugh) we're uh we're going to a father-son picnic, just the two of us.
DAPHNE: I thought we were going to spend the day together.
GEORGE: Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the velcro ball. (laughs)
DAPHNE: Have you given any more thought to what we talked about? You know, moving in?
GEORGE: Yes, oh yes very much.
DAPHNE: Maybe you don't want to move in.
GEORGE: No, no I do. You know it's just...
DAPHNE: (interrupting him) Maybe Al Netchie was right, maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved with you.
GEORGE: (angry that she believes Al was right) No he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! Alright I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.

ELAINE: (Phil cracking up) So then Packyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can bearly hold 'em. I mean he's like trying to juggle (does a juggling motion and begins laughing) the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of...
PHIL: (dying of laughter) I'm peeing in my pants.
ELAINE: (cont.) they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face. (pause as they both continue to laugh really hard) and the whole place went crazy.
PHIL: Oh, I'm sorry, Oh. What a story.
ELAINE: I know, I know, I was unbelievable
(laughter dying)
PHIL: Oh that is one of the funniest stories I've ever heard.
ELAINE: (wipes her eyes because she laughed so hard she cried) I know.
PHIL: Well this has been one hell of a night.
ELAINE: Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.
PHIL: You know, you really are beautiful Elaine.
ELAINE: Oh, well, (pauses) Good night.
PHIL: Good night?
ELAINE: Well (leans in to kiss Phil, then looks down at his pants with a awkward look on her face)

(Jerry sitting on a stool on the phone)
JERRY: (on phone) Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act (pauses for response from Adrian) No new material (Elaine enters) He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week, it killed. (waves hello to Elaine; pauses for response from Adrian) Thank you, thanks fo.. you will not regret this. Ok, Bye. (hangs up phone; to Elaine) Hey.

JERRY: He took what out?
ELAINE: It.

ELAINE: Yea.
JERRY: It.
ELAINE: It.
JERRY: Out.
ELAINE: Out.
JERRY: Well I, I can't believe this. I know Phil, he, he's a good friend of mine. We play softball together. How could this be?
ELAINE: Oh it be. (sarcastically) You got any other friends you want to set me up with?
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hey. (to Elaine) Hey how was your date with Phil Titola?
ELAINE: (to Kramer) He took it out.
(Shocked, Kramer acts like he just got a cold shiver down his back)
KRAMER: Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, they can't breathe in there. It's in human.

[Setting: Monk's]
(Jerry and George sitting at the booth nearest to the door)
GEORGE: So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation... and all of a sudden.
JERRY: It.
GEORGE: It.
JERRY: Out.
GEORGE: Out. (Jerry shakes his head in agreement) Wow. I spend so much time trying to get their clothes off, I never thought of taking mine off. (Jerry nods; George looks at his watch) Alright, Hey come on, get out of here, Dophne gonna be here any minute.
JERRY: Alright I'm going.
GEORGE: You know what I've come to realize? I'm not just bored. I genuinely dislike her.
JERRY: Well how long you are going to keep this up?
GEORGE: Hey I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again.
JERRY: You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.
GEORGE: I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't know what makes me tick.
JERRY: Yes I do.
GEORGE: What are you doing?
JERRY: I'm going to the hospital to see Fulton. I'm not even saying hello, I'm going right into material.

PHIL: You know I'm sorry things didn't work out with Elaine. I don't know what I did wrong.
JERRY: Well, y..you showed her who you are.
(Phil turns to see a woman breast feeding her baby down the hallway)
PHIL: Oh, look at this, what she's got to breast feed in public.

[Setting: ABC Studios set]
KRAMER & MICKEY: Rock, paper, scissors match.
MICKEY: Alright, rock beats paper.
(Mickey smacks Kramer on the hand for losing)
KRAMER: I thought paper covered rock?
MICKEY: Nah, rock flies right through paper.
KRAMER: What beats rock?
MICKEY: (looks at his hand) Nothing beats rock.
KRAMER: Alright come on.
KRAMER & MICKEY: Rock, paper, scissors match.

MICKEY: Hey Tammy.
TAMMY: Hello.
MICKEY: So Tammy, finally, today's our big lunch.
TAMMY: I don't think so.
MICKEY: Why not? What the hell are you talking about?
TAMMY: Look Mickey, everybody knows that you're heightening. It's all over the set.
MICKEY: Wait, wait (goes to grab her arm)
TAMMY: (recoils) Don't touch me. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. All the progress we made over the years and you go and blow it by pulling a stupid stunt like this.
MICKEY: Wait a second, wait a second, you got me all wrong. It was all because of the kid. (numerous little people begin to crowd around them) (to Tammy) The kid was growing. He shot up two and a half inches in a month. (to all the little people) I woulda lost my job. Any one of you would have done the same. You got no right! I'm Mickey Abbott! I stood in for Punky Bruster when all of you was nothing. (seeing the crowd still doesn't agree with what he did, he points at Kramer) It's all his fault. (Kramer acts like he doesn't know what Mickey is talking about) It was his idea.
TAMMY: Come on Johnny, let's go get something to eat.
(all the little people leave including Tammy along with Johnny)
MICKEY: (in complete disgust as seeing Tammy leave with Johnny) AH! (turns and looks at Kramer) AH!

[Setting: Back at Monk's]
(George and Daphne at the booth nearest to the door)
DAPHNE: George, first let me just say I've never been with a guy who was so committed to commit. I mean it's so rare in men these days an, that's what makes this all the more difficult.
GEORGE: (happily) Difficult?
DAPHNE: The other day after work some girlfriends and I went to a bar for some drinks and there was this crazy mishap and I wound up meeting someone as a result. George...
GEORGE: (acting disappointed) Oh, please don't.
DAPHNE: Uh, I'm sorry. I'm afraid the worst of it is it's someone you know. Jerry Persheck.
GEORGE: Packyderm?
DAPHNE: Heh, he was carrying these two pieces of pizza...
[Opening Monologue]
I think that of all the places that you go all the time, the dry-cleaning relationship is one of the most bizarre. Because you keep giving each other the same thing, back and forth, over and over again. He gives it to you, you give it to him, he gives it back to you. It's like it's half his shirt, in a way. He has it as much as you do...you oughta go shopping with him. 'What do you think of this shirt?' 'That would look good with a light starch.' The only warning label people really respect is 'dry-clean only.' Ya know what I mean? Speed limits, lung cancer, cigarette warnings - your very life is at stake! People go, 'Ah, the hell with it!' But dry-clean only? 'Oh, don't put that in the wash! It's dry-clean only! Are you crazy?!'
[Jerry and his girlfriend Meryl at Jerry's apartment. Meryl comes out of Jerry's bedroom.]
MERYL: Good morning.
JERRY: Good morning.
MERYL: How'd you sleep?
JERRY: Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over my side.
MERYL: I was not!
JERRY: C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!
MERYL: By the way, you know you're falling way behind on the 'I love you's.'
JERRY: No, no, 12-8!
MERYL: No, it's 15-8.
JERRY: I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.
MERYL: Alright c'mon, let's get some breakfast.
JERRY: Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll uh try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. (Goes into his room, and comes back out with the jacket on.) Ahh, haven't worn this one in a long time.
MERYL (feels Jerry's material): Ooh, cashmere?
JERRY: No, gore-tex. It's new. (Checks his pockets.) Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that.
MERYL: Wow, this is really old. You don't know whose it is?
JERRY: No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. Maybe we should ask him.
MERYL: Alright, we'll stop over there.
JERRY: Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?
MERYL: Pancakes.
JERRY: Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.
MERYL: I don't know that!
JERRY: But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.
MERYL: I'll get the short stack.
JERRY: Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. (They go out into the hallway and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.) Hey, how ya doin.'
KRAMER: We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite.
JERRY: Hey, is that my maple syrup? Oh, ya. (Kramer hands it over.)
MERYL: You bring your own syrup?
KRAMER: Got to.
JERRY (to Meryl): You got a lot to learn about pancakes.
[Jerry and Meryl at Marty the dry-cleaner's.]
MARTY (looking at the locket): This is my wife. She died eight years ago. I been looking all over for this!
JERRY: Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?
MARTY: Well, see here, the chain is broken...it must have slipped in when I was, uh...(gestures at the racks of clothes behind him.)
JERRY: Oh, wow.
MARTY: I turned my house upside-down looking for this! It's all I have left of her.
MERYL: Oh, that's so touching.
MARTY (to Jerry): Know what I'm gonna do for you? I'm gonna give you and your family 25% off all your dry-cleaning from now on.
JERRY: Oh, come on!
MARTY: What are you talkin' about?
JERRY: It's silly!
MARTY: Hey, forget it!
JERRY: Get outta here!
MARTY: It's done!
JERRY (giving in): Alright.
MERYL: Well, I guess I get it too, because I'm his wife.
MARTY (to Jerry): I didn't know you were married.
JERRY: Oh...yeah...uh you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.
MARTY (to Meryl): Sure, you get the discount, too.
JERRY: You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...
MERYL: I'm taking him to the cleaners!
JERRY: Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...(hugs Meryl.) I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!
(They grab each other's mouths in happiness)
[Elaine on the street outside the New York Health Club. Greg comes out of the club.]
ELAINE: Oh, hi Greg.
GREG: Haven't seen you in a while.
ELAINE: Yeah. Well, actuall today was the first day I worked out since the Central Park Mini-Marathon.
GREG: You ran the Mini-Marathon?
ELAINE: No, but I exercised that day. (Laughs.)
GREG: Well, I-I gotta take off.
ELAINE: Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it. (Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.) Um, do you have the time?
GREG (looks at his watch): Eleven-thirty.
ELAINE (surprised): Eleven-thirty?
GREG: Wait-wait, ten-thirty. Sorry.
ELAINE: Oh.
GREG: Do you have to be somewhere?
ELAINE: No.
GREG: Then what are you doing?
ELAINE: I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together.
GREG: Oh. Well, it was good seeing you.
ELAINE: Yeah, nice to see you, too.
(Greg plants an open-lipped kiss on Elaine and walks away. She looks after him with a puzzled expression.)
[Jerry and Meryl having breakfast at the coffee shop.]
MERYL: Uh, would you, um...can I...
JERRY: Pardon?
MERYL: The syrup. Would you pass the syrup?
JERRY (holds up the syrup bottle): Oh, you want to try the syrup! (Meryl smiles and takes it. The waitress comes over.)
WAITRESS: Can I get you anything else?
JERRY: Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee.
WAITRESS: Okay.
MERYL: And a check for my husband.
JERRY (toasts with his orange juice): To my beautiful wife.
MERYL: To my adoring husband.
JERRY: Adoring? What about handsome?
MERYL: I like adoring.
JERRY: Ya sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? (Meryl laughs. The owner of the coffee shop comes over.)
OWNER (points at the bottle of maple syrup): Excuse me...where did you get that?
JERRY: I, uh...well...
OWNER: Uh, we don't allow any outside syrups, jams or condiments in the restaurant. (To Jerry) And if I catch you in here with that again...I will confiscate it.
JERRY: Well, I-I-I told my wife not to bring it.
[Jerry and Kramer in Jerry's apartment.]
KRAMER: Really? 25% off? Do I get that, too?
JERRY: No, just Meryl.
KRAMER: Why, why? Why does she get it?
JERRY: Because she's my wife! (The door buzzer sounds; Jerry answers it) Yeh?
ELAINE: (on buzzer) Meh.
JERRY: (buzzes her up) Eh. (to Kramer) You know and I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying "my wife." Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - "my wife" this, "my wife" that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence.
KRAMER: "My wife has an inner ear infection."
JERRY: See?
KRAMER: I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?
JERRY: Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in!
KRAMER: C'mon, just this one time! It's expensive!
JERRY: Alright. (Elaine enters.)
KRAMER: Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married in ten years, we get hitched?
ELAINE: Let's make it fifty.
KRAMER: We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt. (Kramer leaves.)
ELAINE: Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?
JERRY: The fly-boy.
ELAINE: Yeah.
JERRY: Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you.
ELAINE: I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.
JERRY: Hmm, So?
ELAINE: So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.
JERRY: Really.
ELAINE: Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim.
JERRY: Ohhh, moisture?
ELAINE: Yeah. Definite moisture.
JERRY: That's an open-lip kiss, alright.
ELAINE: Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. (The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers it.) Yeah?
GEORGE (on intercom): Oh, uh...it's George.
ELAINE: Hey, what happened to you?
GEORGE (meekly): Nothing...little problem.
ELAINE: Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.
GEORGE: Can I come upstairs, please? (Elaine pushes the button and lets George in.)
ELAINE (to Jerry): I mean, maybe he wants to ask me out.
JERRY: I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.
ELAINE: Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and uh he ignores me.
JERRY: Yeah, so?
ELAINE: I respect that. (George enters.) Mmm, what happened?
GEORGE: Nothing, I... said it was a little problem.
ELAINE: Yeah? What was it?
GEORGE (defensive): Well...I was in the locker room showering, and I...I had to go, so...
JERRY: Here we go.
GEORGE: Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look.
ELAINE: You went...in the shower?
GEORGE: Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! (Kramer enters with his quilt.)
ELAINE (to Jerry): Do you go in the shower?
JERRY: No, never.
ELAINE (to Kramer): Do you?
KRAMER: I take baths.
GEORGE: Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?
ELAINE: Did you ever hear of...holding it in?
GEORGE: Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys.
ELAINE: How do you know?
GEORGE: Medical journals!
JERRY: Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?
[Jerry dropping off Kramer's quilt at the dry-cleaners. Meryl is already there dropping off some stuff of her own.]
JERRY: Hello.
MERYL: Oh, hi...honey.
JERRY: What are you doing here?
MERYL: I just thought I'd drop off a few things.
JERRY: Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. (Hands over Kramer's quilt.)
MARTY: Another quilt? Huh? (Uncle Leo enters.)
UNCLE LEO: Jerry!
JERRY: Uncle Leo?!
UNCLE LEO: Hello!
JERRY: Hello.
MARTY (to Jerry): So, if you or your wife want to drop by on Wednesday, it should be ready.
UNCLE LEO: Your wife?
JERRY (hoping Leo will pick up on the scam): Yeah...my wife.
UNCLE LEO: What are you talking about?
JERRY: Uh...I got married.
UNCLE LEO (shocked): You got married? I wasn't invited? Nobody sends me an invitation?
JERRY: Well, it was sudden.
UNCLE LEO: Are you ashamed of your uncle? Do I embarrass you?
JERRY: No, no, it was a small ceremony.
UNCLE LEO: Haven't I always been a good uncle?
JERRY: Yes, yes, you have.
UNCLE LEO: Who told you when you went to school that you print well?
JERRY: You did, you did.
UNCLE LEO (to Meryl): When he was younger, he had a beautiful penmanship. I used to encourage him to print.
JERRY: I'm a good printer.
UNCLE LEO: I remember your 'V.' It was like a perfect triangle. Whoa, there's my bus! (Rushes out.) Hello! Wait!
(Jerry tries to catch Leo before he runs off to tell him about his "pretend marriage," but doesn't make it.)
JERRY: Uncle Leo, wait!
[Elaine talking with Greg while he's on a Stairmaster at the health club.]
GREG: I'm glad you're here. This can get really boring. Do you know where I can get some good olives?
ELAINE: I can find out.
GREG: Would ya?
ELAINE: Sure. (thinking) Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal.
GREG: By the way, you look really great in that leotard.
ELAINE: Oh, thanks. (thinking) That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.
GREG: Hey, you know what's weird? I think I had a dream about you last night.
ELAINE: (thinking) Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out. (to Greg) Um, you know Greg, I...
GREG: Can I have a sip of your water?
ELAINE: Oh, yeah, sure. (Hands Greg her bottle.)
GREG: Thanks. (Is about to take a drink, but wipes the neck of the bottle with his shirt first.)
ELAINE: (shocked expression; thinking) Oh my God.
GREG (hands the bottle back): I'm sorry, what were you saying?
ELAINE: Oh, it was nothing, for-forget it. (George enters the gym.)
GREG: See that guy right there?
ELAINE: Yup, you mean him?
GREG: I caught him urinating in the shower. I'm thinking about turning him in, too.
(On the other side of the room, George falls off an exercise machine and gets his foot caught in it.)
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Meryl is lounging on the couch, watching TV and eating chocolates.)
MERYL: Honey? Could you get me something to drink?
JERRY (from his bedroom hallway, alluding to the fact that she should get the drink herself): You're right there.
MERYL: C'mon, I'm sitting! (Jerry walks to the kitchen, annoyed. Meryl laughs at the TV show she's watching.)
JERRY (looking in a drawer): Honey, what'd you do with the can opener?
MERYL: I didn't do anything with it.
JERRY: Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.
MERYL: It's in the first drawer.
JERRY: I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.
MERYL: Yes, it is.
JERRY (irritated): Hey...I'm not stupid. I'm looking in that drawer, there's no can opener.
MERYL: Did I say you were stupid?
JERRY (angrily): Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener - what other conclusion could one reach? (The phone rings.)
MERYL (getting up): Do you want me to go find it?
JERRY (slams the drawer): Yes. I do. You show me where there's a can opener in that drawer. (Answers the phone.) Hello! I'm sorry, I'm just fighting with my wife.
(Morty and Helen in Florida, each with phone in hand.)
HELEN: Jerry, we just heard, what's going on?
MORTY: Why the hell didn't you tell us?
JERRY: Listen, Ma...
MERYL (looking in the drawer): It was in here yesterday!
JERRY (angrily): Yeah, that's what I said!
HELEN: Who is she? When did this happen?
MORTY (to Jerry): I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never do it.
HELEN: Morty, you're talking too loud.
MORTY: I'm not talking loud!
HELEN: You're hurting my eardrum.
MERYL (looking for the can opener): Well, you must have done something with it!
JERRY (to Meryl): I'm on the phone!
HELEN: Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name?
JERRY: Mom, I'm not married.
HELEN: What?
JERRY: I'm not married!
MORTY: I knew it, I told you!
HELEN (to Jerry): Uncle Leo said.
JERRY: I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.
HELEN: A discount on dry-cleaning?
JERRY (to Meryl, who's making a racket in the kitchen looking for the can opener): Could you make a little more noise? (To his parents) Listen, I'm gonna have to call you later.
MERYL (not finding the opener): Well, I give up.
JERRY: Well, whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.)
KRAMER: Got any coffee?
JERRY: Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?
KRAMER: My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. (Frantic) I can't get into a zone!
JERRY: What is that? (Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.)
KRAMER: Huh?
JERRY: That?
KRAMER: Oh, I forgot. (Hands back Jerry's can opener.)
(Jerry after receiving the can opener smiles at Meryl)
[Jerry and Meryl in bed later that night.]
JERRY: Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.
MERYL: Yeah, me too. I Love you.
JERRY: I Love you.
MERYL: Well, goodnight.
JERRY: Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.)
[Jerry, George and Elaine in Jerry's apartment the next day.]
GEORGE: They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!
ELAINE: So what do you want me to do?
GEORGE: Talk to him!
ELAINE: How can I do that?
GEORGE: You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!
ELAINE (enunciating clearly so George gets the point): Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!
GEORGE: Well, that doesn't mean anything!
ELAINE: Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!
JERRY (patiently while watching tv): She's right, George. Bottle-wipe is big.
GEORGE: Well, what about the open-lipped kiss?
JERRY: (still watching tv; sounds like basketball) Bottle-wipe supercedes it.
GEORGE: Yeah, you're right, you're right. (To Elaine) Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?
ELAINE: George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him.
GEORGE: Why?
ELAINE: I...I don't know...
GEORGE: Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!
ELAINE: No, that's not it!
GEORGE: Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!
ELAINE: Why couldn't you just wait?
GEORGE: I was there! I saw a drain!
ELAINE: Since when is a drain a toilet?!
GEORGE: It's all pipes! What's the difference?!
ELAINE: Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up!
GEORGE: I'll call a plumber right now! (Goes for the phone.)
JERRY: Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?
ELAINE (to George): Okay! Okay! Okay, I will talk to him. (Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: Jerry, I think that quilt is ready.
JERRY: Alright.
KRAMER: Well, you gotta pick it up for me!
JERRY: Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!
KRAMER: I'm so tired!
ELAINE (to Kramer): Boy, you don't look good.
KRAMER: Huh? I don't?
ELAINE: No, you look pale.
KRAMER: Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! (The phone rings.)
JERRY: Hello? Oh, hi honey. (annoyed, weary) Yes, I told him. I'll get it. (George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry to argue with Meryl on the phone.) Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...
[Jerry at the dry-cleaners. Kramer paces outside impatiently, waiting for his quilt.]
MARTY: I'm sorry, it's not ready yet. (Kramer bursts in.)
KRAMER: Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here?
MARTY: Who the hell are you? Huh, It's not your quilt.
JERRY: He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.
MARTY: Well, uh...maybe tomorrow.
KRAMER (angrily, to Jerry): Maybe.
JERRY: Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay.
KRAMER: Alright, I'm gonna see you later.
JERRY: Where you goin'?
KRAMER: I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines.
JERRY: I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.
KRAMER: Hey, that's how I maintain my glow.
JERRY: I'm goin' home.
KRAMER: Ya.
(Kramer exits. An attractive woman enters the dry-cleaners with a bundle of clothes in her hands. Jerry notices her and waits by the door.)
PAULA (to Marty, in a foreign accent): Excuse me? Uh, how much would it cost to clean this?
MARTY: Oh, about thirteen dollars.
PAULA: Thirteen? Well, I can't afford that.
MARTY: Well, I'm sorry.
(Paula turns around to leave and runs into Jerry. They smile at each other.)
[Elaine and Greg at the health club. A sweaty Greg is exercising on a leg machine.]
ELAINE: Hi, Greg.
GREG: Hey, Elaine. I'll be off in a second.
ELAINE: Ok. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.) I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.)
GREG (to Elaine): Oh, well, It's all yours. (Walks away. Elaine looks at the machine, then George runs over.)
GEORGE: What happened? Did he bring it up?
ELAINE: Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.
GEORGE: Signal? What signal?
ELAINE: Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.
GEORGE: I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!
ELAINE: Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.
GEORGE: A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?
ELAINE: Yeah! It's a social thing.
GEORGE: What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him!
ELAINE: No! I won't be a party to this.
GEORGE: So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?
ELAINE: Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.)
[Jerry and Paula in a booth at the coffee shop. Jerry is trying to get the bundle of clothes from her so he can pay for the dry-cleaning.]
PAULA: I won't let you do this!
JERRY: I want to!
PAULA: But it isn't right! I can't.
JERRY: Give me the clothes.
PAULA: Jerry, please. What about her?
JERRY: Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.)
PAULA: No, Jerry, please!
JERRY: I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.
PAULA (hands over the clothes): I can't fight you. (They embrace and kiss passionately.)
JERRY: Do you want box or hanger?
PAULA: You decide. (Jerry considers.)
[Kramer in a tanning booth at the health club. He lies down on the tanning bed and bonks his head.]
[Health Club]
(Elaine and Greg in the weight room.)
ELAINE: You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?
GREG: Yeah. (Spies the shapely manager of the health club.) Oh, there's the manager. Good. I think I'm gonna talk to her about that guy, you know, we cannot have people like that in here.
ELAINE: Are you sure you want to do that?
GREG: Yeah. He's disgusting! Besides, I'll take any chance I can to talk to her.
ELAINE: You're interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.)
GREG: Very.
ELAINE: Ah. You know, uh..I'm engaged. (preens) Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.)
GREG: Oh good, there he is. I wanna be able to point him out.
ELAINE: You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
GREG: Why?
ELAINE: Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?
GREG: Oh, I see...you're friends with the urinator, aren't you?
ELAINE: Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.
[Kramer lying on the health club tanning bed - fast asleep and snoring.]
[Meryl picking up her clothes at the dry-cleaners.]
MARTY: Here you go, Mrs. Seinfeld...with your 25% discount, it comes to $17.80.
MERYL: Here you go. (Pays Marty, then looks at the clothes on the hanger.) Excuse me, this isn't mine.
MARTY: Oh, yes it is. Your husband brought it in himself.
MERYL: Really? (Takes her change and grabs the clothes off the hanger.) Thank you. (Exits.)
[Anna with her family and friends at her apartment.]
(There's a knock at the door.)
ANNA: That's him! (Opens the door. Kramer stands there, deeply tanned and smiling. Anna and her grandfather are shocked.)
[Jerry's apartment.]
(Jerry and Meryl)
MERYL (throws Paula's clothes at Jerry): You son of a bitch!
JERRY: I'm sorry.
MERYL: Who is she? I want to know who she is.
JERRY: It doesn't matter. I want a divorce.
MERYL: A divorce? Oh, so you can marry her and give her the discount?
JERRY: Yes, that's right.
MERYL: What happened to us, Jerry?
JERRY: I'll tell you what happened. We got married.
MERYL: I'm sorry, uh.. this is my fault. I pushed it on you.
JERRY: No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.
MERYL: Goodbye, Jerry. Oh, I forgot...(reaches in her purse)...this is your maple syrup.
JERRY: It's alright, I want you to have it.
MERYL: (sentimental) Okay, thanks.
JERRY: We'll always have...pancakes.
MERYL: Bye, Jerry. (Exits.)
[Anna's Apartment]
GRANDPA (to Anna): I thought you said you was bringin' a white boy home! I don't see a white boy! I see a damn fool!
(Kramer stands there, grinning foolishly.)
[Closing Monologue]
To me the thing about marriage is, I can't believe how often it happens. I mean I like the idea of it, but I can't believe that many people are meetin' people that they want to see every single day, everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday. That should like happen three or four times... you know in the whole century. Like in every major investment you have to sign a marriage contract here's your person, if you are a man the bride's family pays for the wedding - that's like getting cash back. Till death to us part, that's the extended warranty program and they give you the ring - that's the keys, you slide it on start 'em up. But you gotta try and make it work because remember - your value drops twenty percent the minute you drive each other off the lot.
[Opening Monologue]
I really feel as human beings, we need more training in our basic social skills. Conversational Distance, don't you hate these people that talk to you they talk into your mouth like you're a clown at a drive-through and Hand shakes is the worst, there's absolutely no guidelines for hand shakes you know these people? Too long, too weak, sometimes they give you the three-quarter handshake just the fingers, early release, late release, sometimes people will dispute your release, you let go there're hangin' on. I have actually said to people 'Hey the handshake is over!.' Too many pumps, coming in too high, too sweaty, coming from too far away. Sometimes a guy will give you a strong grip, late release, and pull you in for the too close conversation. To him I say 'That's three strikes you're out.'
[Monk's]
(George and Jerry at the usual booth)
JERRY: You know their timing couldn't be worse.
GEORGE: Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?
JERRY: You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.
GEORGE: When are they leaving for Paris?
JERRY: Not for another three days.
GEORGE: What about her place?
JERRY: She lives with her parents.
GEORGE: Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.
JERRY: (sarcastically) Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.
GEORGE: Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?
JERRY: The baldies
GEORGE: Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.
JERRY: That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.
(Alec and Joey enter)
ALEC: (walking over to Jerry and George's table) Hey guys.
GEORGE: Hey Alec
JERRY: Hey Alec
ALEC: This is Joey.
GEORGE: Hey Joey, how you doin'?
ALEC: (Joey was about to talk) Hey listen, I was wondering if either one of you guys would be interested in doing some work for the Big Brother program? I'm kinda running the local chapter. What do you say George?
GEORGE: Well uh....
JOEY: (interrupts) Wouldn't you like to be a big brother to someone like me? Please?
GEORGE: Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.
ALEC: That's great George, thanks a lot I'll get in touch with you.
JOEY: Wouldn't you like to be a big brother..
ALEC: (grabs Joey to stop him) Ya alright Joey that's enough, let's go (walking over to the counter) See ya.
JERRY: What happened?
GEORGE: What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?
JERRY: (acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?
[Street]
(Jerry and George walking down the sidewalk.)
JERRY: Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?
GEORGE: Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.
JERRY: Ya, it's much better isn't it?
GEORGE: Oh, n-no comparison.
JERRY: Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.
GEORGE: (stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: Your parents are going to Paris right?
JERRY: Yea?
GEORGE: So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.
JERRY: What about little Joey?
GEORGE: Who?
JERRY: Ah, I think he's probably better off.
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Morty and Helen are sitting at Jerry's Table; Jerry and George are standing by them)
GEORGE: I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.
MORTY: But there are no stamps on these.
GEORGE: Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll reimburse you of course.
HELEN: Why are you doing this?
JERRY: He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.
HELEN: Why?
JERRY: Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?
HELEN: I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion)
KRAMER: (putting on the lotion) Ya
HELEN: It's from the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.
KRAMER: Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida.
JERRY: Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.
KRAMER: Ya
MORTY: Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.
KRAMER: Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.
GEORGE: Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?
KRAMER: Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.
GEORGE: What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?
KRAMER: Well I suppose the children do.
GEORGE: (pondering) Yes I suppose they do.
KRAMER: (takes another smell of his hands) Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, I'll see everybody later.
(Kramer goes to turn the door knob and falls straight to the floor slipping off the knob, then continues to try to open the door with no one really watching; He then uses his coat to get a grip and then smiles and exits)
GEORGE: (grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What about tonight?
(Morty and Helen look at each other)
HELEN: Tonight?
GEORGE: Yea they're making Paella.
HELEN: (looking at Morty) Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it tonight, (turns toward George) we have plans.
JERRY: (watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans?
HELEN: (turns to Jerry) We have plans.
JERRY: Where'd you get plans?
HELEN: (annoyed) We have plans.
GEORGE: Well um, what about tomorrow night?
HELEN: (turns back toward George) Maybe
GEORGE: Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.
MORTY: (to George as he is about to leave) Hey give 'em our best though.
GEORGE: (quietly) Ya.
JERRY: (walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.
GEORGE: Ya.
(George tries to open the door hand slips then he exits; Jerry makes sure the door is closed)
JERRY: So what plans do you have?
MORTY: None
JERRY: So how come you're not going over there for dinner?
HELEN: Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.
MORTY: We can't stand them.
JERRY: Really? Since when?
HELEN: Since always. We've never liked them.
JERRY: Why?
HELEN: Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice?
JERRY: No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.
MORTY: Well we do.
(Buzzer; Jerry goes over to answer it)
JERRY: Ya?
(Elaine and Aaron are heard laughing on the Intercom)
ELAINE: It's us.
JERRY: U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you?
HELEN: We adore Elaine.
JERRY: She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.
HELEN: What's he like?
JERRY: He's nice, bit of a close talker.
HELEN: A what?
JERRY: You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about the Costanzas'
HELEN: They're exhausting it's like being in an Asylum.
(Elaine and Aaron enter)
EVERYONE: Hi.
MORTY: Hello Elaine
(Morty and Helen give Elaine a hug)
ELAINE: This is Aaron.
HELEN: Hello Aaron
MORTY: Hello.
AARON: (getting up in Helen's face) So how long you folks in town?
HELEN: Oh, three more days, three more days then we're off to Paris.
AARON: Ah
MORTY: We're going with a select charter group.
AARON: I love France, (moving over to Morty's face) I was just there last year. In fact, you know I still have an envelope full of French Franks, I'll give 'em to ya.
HELEN: We can't take money.
AARON: Oh, no, it's a gift. (looking toward Elaine) from us.
ELAINE: Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice? (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time?
JERRY: No I haven't.
AARON: You know (to Morty) I have a friend who works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. How would you like a behind the scenes tour?
HELEN: (grabbing Aaron) Really, you could do that?
AARON: (up in Helen's face) Easily
HELEN: I wouldn't be any trouble?
AARON: (gets closer) Of course not.
HELEN: When would we go?
AARON: How about right now?
MORTY: I'm ready
HELEN: Are you sure?
AARON: Yes.
HELEN: Ok, let me get my coat.
(Helen goes to get her coat)
AARON: (walking over to Elaine and getting into her face) Elaine what do you say?
ELAINE: W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans.
AARON: Oh. (getting into Jerry's face) How about you Jerry?
JERRY: I'm swamped.
AARON: You sure? You could examine the art work up close.
JERRY: Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.
ELAINE: (under her breath) Ya that'll happen)
AARON: (Moving toward the door) Alright. We're off.
(Aaron, Helen and Morty heading out the door)
MORTY: Ok, bye.
HELEN & AARON: Bye.
JERRY: Ok buh bye. Have a good time.
ELAINE: Bye.
AARON: See everybody later (Morty and Helen leave; Aaron closes the door blowing Elaine a kiss)
JERRY: Ok.
ELAINE: Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?
JERRY: I don't know.
ELAINE: What is that?
JERRY: Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
ELAINE: Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?
JERRY: Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.
(Jerry walks over to the couch sits down and picks up the phone)
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: (dialing) He got em out of the house.
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: Call Rachel.
ELAINE: Oh.
JERRY: (on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel! (hangs up the phone very disappointed)
ELAINE: (putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.
(Elaine kisses at Jerry; Jerry looks at her in disgust)
[Costanza House]
FRANK: They're not coming?
GEORGE: No, they had plans.
ESTELLE: How could they have plans?
GEORGE: That's what I wanna know.
FRANK: Well what difference does it make? They wouldn't lie to us, they're are dear friends.
ESTELLE: What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
GEORGE: They said tomorrow, maybe.
FRANK: Maybe?
ESTELLE: Maybe they don't like us.
FRANK: Why wouldn't they like us? (tastes the Paella; disgusted) Again with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for?
ESTELLE: Ah keep quiet.
FRANK: What are you trying to set my mouth on fire?
GEORGE: I don't know what the reason could be.
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Morty, Helen and Aaron enter)
JERRY: (disappointed) Oh, Hi, hi.
AARON: Ah Jerry you would not believe the time we had.
HELEN: Aaron is quite the tour guide.
MORTY: Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?
JERRY: Oh sure like Monet.
MORTY: Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean know body would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.
JERRY: Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.
MORTY: I say the guy was painting without his glasses.
(phone rings)
JERRY: (answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.
HELEN: Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read.
JERRY: Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs phone up)
AARON: Well I should be going.
HELEN: Oh thanks again.
AARON & HELEN: Buh bye.
(Kramer enters)
AARON: Oh you must be Kramer (advances on Kramer to close to his face Kramer walks back into the fridge to avoid him and falls to the ground) I've heard about you.
KRAMER: You must be Aaron, I've heard about you.
AARON: (Laughing) Well see you later.
KRAMER: Yeah.
AARON: (leaving) Bye
JERRY: Bye
KRAMER: So uh what are you guys doing for dinner?
HELEN: We have no plans.
MORTY: (noticing Kramer's coat) Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive.
KRAMER: Now what is Executive?
JERRY: The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
MORTY: I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.
HELEN: Why would they? Know body bought them then.
MORTY: He's wearing one.
KRAMER: Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.
MORTY: You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?
KRAMER: Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything.
MORTY: You gotta deal.
(Kramer and Morty shake hands)
KRAMER: Yaaaa.
JERRY: This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
MORTY: I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery.
HELEN: You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.
MORTY: He'll send them express.
HELEN: You're crazy.
MORTY: I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.
JERRY: N-na I'm paying for the trip.
MORTY: So much the better.
[Monk's]
(George and Alec are sitting at the booth closest to the door)
GEORGE: Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.
ALEC: Paris huh?
GEORGE: Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for.
ALEC: Where will you stay?
GEORGE: An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.
ALEC: George, you have no idea how fantastic this is.
GEORGE: Fantastic?
ALEC: Ya, we've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives in Paris. But he's afraid to fly alone, you know he's kinda withdrawn, but he seems to take to you. (George smiling in surprise) So it's a perfect solution.
GEORGE: How gee what a coincidence.
ALEC: And you'll send me a postcard.
[Elaine's Apartment]
(Elaine and Aaron lying in bed)
AARON: Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir. I think she really connected to the way he painted children.
ELAINE: Mm hmm.
AARON: And that Morty, I'll tell ya that guy is full of life. (laughs) He was convinced Monet was near sighted. I kept telling him
ELAINE: Aaron
AARON: Yes?
ELAINE: Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?
AARON: Well, they were in from out of town, I thought they would enjoy it.
ELAINE: Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?
AARON: No, it was fun.
ELAINE: You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
AARON: Yea, they bought me a coke.
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Morty and Jerry are sitting at his table; Kramer is standing next to Morty; Helen is getting the fold out sofa ready to sleep)
KRAMER: So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?
MORTY: I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.
KRAMER: How serendipitous.
MORTY: So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
KRAMER: Mmm
JERRY: He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.
KRAMER: Did you call Jack Klompus yet?
MORTY: I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.
JERRY: Ah come on.
MORTY: Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone)
HELEN: Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?
JERRY: No I haven't seen it yet.
HELEN: Oh you have to go you have to
JERRY: I'm going
HELEN: You have to
JERRY: Ok
MORTY: (on the phone) Hello Jack.
(Jack in Florida)
JACK: Ya
MORTY: It's Morty
JACK: Who died?
MORTY: Know body died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of boxes.
JACK: What boxes?
MORTY: I'm gonna explain what boxes.
JACK: Alright how the hell do I know?
MORTY: Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.
JACK: I thought you're going to Paris
MORTY: I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.
JACK: What's in the boxes?
MORTY: Raincoats.
JACK: Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage.
HELEN: I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.
JACK: When do you want these?
MORTY: Send them tomorrow.
[Costanza House)
(George, Estelle and Frank are sitting at the table for breakfast all still in what they slept in)
ESTELLE: You think they're coming tonight?
GEORGE: I dunno they said maybe.
FRANK: Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us.
ESTELLE: Well they better come, I got all this Paella.
FRANK: I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.
GEORGE: Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.
ESTELLE: Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?
GEORGE: I-I wasn't in the attic.
ESTELLE: I heard noise.
GEORGE: Maybe it was a mouse.
FRANK: (jumping to his feet) OK that's it! We're moving!
GEORGE: What?
FRANK: I will not tolerate infestation.
GEORGE: You haven't even seen one.
FRANK: Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again.
ESTELLE: Alright Frank that's enough.
(Frank sits back down)
[Rudy's Antique Boutique]
(Rudy is checking out the clothes)
GEORGE: I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing)
RUDY: Uh huh.
GEORGE: They will get a good home won't they?
RUDY: Look I gotta be honest with you there's nothing here too spectacular.
GEORGE: Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a casanova really.
RUDY: I'll give you uh two-hundred dollars for the three boxes.
GEORGE: Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.
RUDY: Yea I'm in a good mood here.
GEORGE: Thank you.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hey, George what are you doing here?
GEORGE: Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, (looking into Kramer's eyes) that's what he would have wanted.
KRAMER: Oh, I gotcha (clicks)
GEORGE: (leaving) That'll do.
KRAMER: Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats.
GEORGE: Hey that's swell.
KRAMER: Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night.
GEORGE: Dinner? (grabs Kramer)
KRAMER: Ya.
GEORGE: You had dinner with the Seinfelds'?
KRAMER: Yea, last night.
GEORGE: Was this something you had planned for a while?
KRAMER: No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants.
GEORGE: (hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, They had plans!
KRAMER: Oooo, boy I've never seen these before (looking at the clothes George just sold Rudy)
RUDY: Well they just came in, part of my spring-time cruise collection. Two for twenty-five dollars.
KRAMER: Oh I'll take these.
RUDY: Alright
KRAMER: Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?
RUDY: Sure that's the Executive.
KRAMER: Ya, you have any others?
RUDY: I wish, they don't make 'em anymore.
KRAMER: Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?
RUDY: Very interested
KRAMER: Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.
RUDY: Well bring 'em in.
KRAMER: So you'll buy them?
RUDY: I don't see what would possibly stop me.
(Out of one of the boxes George sold Rudy flies a couple of moths as the scene ends)
[Jerry's Apartment]
(George enters)
GEORGE: Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans!
JERRY: What are you talking about?
GEORGE: Mom and Pop Seinfeld
JERRY: Look I don't know.
GEORGE: Alright I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.
JERRY: Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.
GEORGE: So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?
JERRY: That's right.
GEORGE: Is there something wrong with my parents?
JERRY: Absolutely
GEORGE: Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.
JERRY: These the people you currently live with?
GEORGE: Yes.
JERRY: Uh huh
GEORGE: So are they coming tonight or not?
JERRY: Look I really don't know what they're plans are.
GEORGE: Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.
JERRY: What is that anyway?
GEORGE: It's a spanish dish. It's a moulage of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.
JERRY: I-I'll tell 'em
GEORGE: Hey could you do one other thing for me?
JERRY: Name it.
GEORGE: You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smilies) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps)
JERRY: So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?
GEORGE: (pause) Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.
[Elaine's Office]
(Elaine at her desk; Joanna standing near the door)

ELAINE: Oh, Great.
MORTY: (looking around) This is some office. What's the square footage?
HELEN: You don't mind to you Elaine?
ELAINE: Mind? Oh o-of course not.
AARON: We can make a whole day of it.
MORTY: This is some building, Harry Fleming used to have an office here. There was a deli on the first floor. You don't get corned beef like that anymore. What happened to that deli?
ELAINE: (somewhat annoyed) I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld
[Collection of Scenes with the music and singing from "My Fair Lady" over them. First the matinée where we see (from left to right) Helen, Morty, Elaine and Aaron.

George then smacks the top of the cab in disgust]
(song from "My Fair Lady") "I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night, and still have begged for more. I could have spread my wings, and done a thousand things, I've never done before. I never know what made it so exciting, but all at once my heart would fly"

(Doris enters the scene with Jack)
DORIS: Tell him to come down here and get his own packages. You have nothing better to do then worry about his boxes.
MORTY: You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it.
JACK: Get the hell outta here with your knob.
DORIS: What does he want from you?
MORTY: My idiot son could open that garage door.
JERRY: What did I do?
MORTY: Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need it.
(Jack is seen hanging up his phone)

[Costanza House]
(George, Estelle and Frank all standing in the kitchen)
GEORGE: They were drinking champaign in a buggy!
FRANK: First Kramer, then Elaine?
GEORGE: Yea
FRANK: It's a slap in the face.
ESTELLE: (with her arms out in wonder) What did we ever do to them? (George puts his arms out and imitates Estelle as she moves her arms up and down as she speaks) I want to know what we did them!
FRANK: What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy and sell 'em like that.
(Frank leaves the kitchen and moves into the living room)
ESTELLE: The hell with them.
GEORGE: (in the threshold between the living room and the kitchen) The thing that bothers me the most, is the lying.
(George and Estelle move their way into the living room)
FRANK: Let's forget about it. We're going on a beautiful vacation. (sits down in his chair)
GEORGE: (sitting down) Vacation?
FRANK: You're mother and I are planning on taking a cruise.
(Estelle is already sitting next to George on the couch)
GEORGE: (claps all happy) AH! (half hugs Estelle)
FRANK: But I can't find any vacation clothes. They were in the attic.
GEORGE: The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.
FRANK: How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those, those clothes. (Looks down yells) AH! (jumps out of his chair) A mouse! I saw a mouse! (takes off into another room with glass doors on it and shuts the door)
GEORGE: (picking up what Frank saw as a mouse) It's the remote.
FRANK: (looking from the room; you can see him through the glass) Where the hell are my clothes? I love those clothes.
[Ally outside Rudy's]
(Rudy has a gasoline bottle and is burning some clothes)
RUDY: Lousy moth ridden crap.
[Median Monologue]
I-I-I'm not crazy about used clothes. I mean they call it vintage, you know to take your mind off of what it really is 'nasty wear.' Oh it's clean you know people wear underwear, ya well they don't wear iron underwear and that's what it's gonna take to get me in those clothes. I mean I'll move into an apartment after a strange person moves out, why would I wanna move into somebody's pants? There is no vintage underwear of course, but it's not because the guy couldn't sell his underwear, it's because men wear their underwear until it absolutely disintegrates. Men hang on to underwear until, until each individual underwear molecule is so strained it can barely retain the properties of a solid. It actually becomes underwear vapor. W-we don't even throw it out, we just open a window and it goes out like dandelion spoors. That's how men throw out underwear we just go (blows on the mic) and it's gone that it is jus.
[Movie Theater: Schindler's List]
(Schindler's List is playing as Jerry and Rachel are making out. Newman is then seen disgusted by this display)
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry Enters; Morty and Helen are sitting at the table with a map out)
JERRY: Hey.
MORTY: Hey, Jerry.
HELEN: So how was the movie?
JERRY: Oh, really good, really good.
HELEN: And didn't the three hours go by just like that (snaps her fingers)
JERRY: Like that (snaps his fingers)
MORTY: What about the end, with the list?
JERRY: Ya that was some list.
HELEN: What did you think about the black and white?
JERRY: (confused) The black and white.
MORTY: The whole movie was in black and white.
JERRY: Oh yea, I didn't even realize.
MORTY: You don't even think about it, there's so much going on.
JERRY: Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.
[Rudy's Antique Boutique]
KRAMER: So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) jus get it in there (jiggling making a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle reiggle
RUDY: Look, I find this whole thing very uninteresting. When you get the coats come in.
KRAMER; Ya hey I'm on your side.
(George enters)
KRAMER: Hey what again?
GEORGE: I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.
KRAMER: Paella, ya I'll be there.
GEORGE: Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner.
KRAMER: No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent.
GEORGE: Twenty-five percent? It was your idea.
KRAMER: Yap I know.
GEORGE: You're doing all the leg work.
KRAMER: That's right
GEORGE: He's ripping you off
KRAMER: You're right he's ripping me off
GEORGE: If anybody should be getting more it's you.
KRAMER: He's ripping me off
GEORGE: Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.
KRAMER: YAH! (exits)
RUDY: (coming out of the back-room noticing George) Oh it's you? You're the one who sold me the moth ridden cabana crap.
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Morty coming out of the bathroom)
MORTY: You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?
HELEN: Well he told you about the place.
MORTY: So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?
HELEN: You find something you get a fee.
MORTY: Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.
HELEN: Well it's too late now.
MORTY: Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting years for this pay off.
HELEN: Well you're not gonna say anything.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: I've been thinking about something.
MORTY: Ya so have I
KRAMER: Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.
MORTY: You don't think it's fair.
KRAMER: No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg work.
MORTY: What leg work?
KRAMER: Oh, there's leg work.
MORTY: If anything you're getting too much.
KRAMER: Too much?!
MORTY: That's right, they're my coats.
KRAMER: Look I want thirty-five percent.
MORTY: I'm thinking more like fifteen.
KRAMER: No way I'm taking fifteen.
MORTY: Well you're not getting thirty-five.
KRAMER: Alright let's compromise. Twenty-five percent.
MORTY: Ok it's a deal
(They shack hands.)
[Rudy's Antique Boutique]
RUDY: Moths are a discourage to my business, all it takes is one moth to lay eggs. You know what happens to the larvae? They hatch and they're everywhere.
GEORGE: I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-I'll have the clothes.
RUDY: (counting the money to make sure it's all there) It's already put a dent in my fumigation bill.
GEORGE: So uh where are the clothes?
RUDY: I burned 'em.
GEORGE: Oh. That's good.
[Monk's]
(Jerry and Elaine sitting in the booth)
ELAINE: N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?
JERRY: It is a tad askew.
ELAINE: I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?
JERRY: I've hardly been out to dinner with them.
ELAINE: See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but know body is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.
JERRY: You're right he's insane.
ELAINE: Yes, he's insane, that's what I think.
JERRY: So what are you going to do?
ELAINE: I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie?
JERRY: Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.
ELAINE: Ya what do you mean from what you saw?
JERRY: Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.
ELAINE: Yea why not?
JERRY: I was kind of um (pauses) making out.
ELAINE: (thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's List?
JERRY: I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.
ELAINE: During Schindler's List?
JERRY: (trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents.
ELAINE: Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?
JERRY: No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.
ELAINE: Oh.
[Jerry's Apartment]
(A knock at the door prior to the reveal of Jerry's apartment; Morty is sitting at the table Helen closes the refrigerator to answer the door; Newman is revealed in his full Newman)
NEWMAN: Hello Mrs. Seinfeld
HELEN: (like Jerry) Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here. (goes to shut the door on him)
NEWMAN: Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his pocket)
HELEN: Wonderful, we went to the theater last night.
NEWMAN: Oh the theater. Because I was wondering.
HELEN: Wondering what?
NEWMAN: Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.
HELEN: Well we already saw it.
NEWMAN: Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.
MORTY: (getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that?
NEWMAN: Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.
HELEN: I'm afraid I don't.
NEWMAN: Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.
MORTY: What?
NEWMAN: What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.
HELEN: Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?
NEWMAN: Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.
HELEN: Jerry sends his laundry out.
NEWMAN: (laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing)
(Helen closes the door and looks at Morty in disgust)
[Jerry's Apartment-Later that day]
(Jerry enters; Morty is sitting on the couch writing, Helen is in the bathroom)
JERRY: Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do?
HELEN: How could you?
JERRY: How could I what?
HELEN: You were making out during Schindler's List?
JERRY: What? No.
MORTY: Don't lie Jerry.
JERRY: (turns) Newman.
HELEN: How could you do such a thing?
JERRY: I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.
(Morty and Helen both sigh and turn to go back to what they were doing; Phone rings)
JERRY: (answering the phone) Hello.
(Jack in Florida with a bandage on his right hand)
JACK: Hello Jerry, it's Jack Klompus.
JERRY: Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad it's Klompus.
MORTY: Hello
JACK: Hello Morty, listen that key doesn't work. It's no good.
MORTY: You didn't get in?
JACK: Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got my hand all cut up reaching in.
MORTY: You broke the window?
HELEN: He broke the window?
JACK: You wanted those damn boxes didn't you?
DORIS: (off camera) He should be on his hands and knees thanking you.
MORTY: Did you send them?
JACK: Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock.
MORTY: Tomorrow afternoon?
HELEN: Tomorrow afternoon?
JERRY: Tomorrow afternoon?
MORTY: I told you to send them express.
JACK: W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning, I figured what the hell's the difference.
MORTY: So what did you do about the window?
JACK: I gotta fix your window now?
MORTY: Alright alright, goodbye. (Morty hangs up the phone, Jack hangs up the phone) I don't think we are gonna make that flight.
JERRY: W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?
HELEN: We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off.
MORTY: Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.
(Jerry annoyed walks toward his room)
HELEN: Some place else? What about Paris?
MORTY: You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now.
HELEN: I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats.
MORTY: You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come back.
HELEN: I think you're out of your mind.
[Costanza House]
FRANK: I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear.
GEORGE: Moths?
FRANK: Moths, ate three boxes?
GEORGE: Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere.
ESTELLE: You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway, he's an idiot all together. (Knocking at the door) Ah there's Kramer.
(Estelle goes to answer the door)
KRAMER: (from outside) Hello?
ESTELLE: Hello
KRAMER: (still outside) Helowwwowwow (Estelle opens the door) Hey (kisses Estelle hello) Ha ha, Good evening (George waves)
ESTELLE: Hope you're hungry. (goes into the kitchen)
KRAMER: Ooo Paella
GEORGE: Hey uh let me take you're coat.
KRAMER: (giving George his coat) Oh ya thanks buddy.
FRANK: That shirt, where'd you get that shirt?
KRAMER: Wha?
FRANK: That's my cabana shirt, you stole my shirt you son of a bitch! (really fast) George you let your friends go up in my attic and steal my clothes? (grabbing at the shirt) Gimme that back
KRAMER: (trying to get away) woah
GEORGE: Dad?!
KRAMER: (laughs as Frank ends up tickling him; gets away) I bought it from Rudy.
GEORGE: Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.
FRANK: Who's Rudy? What clothes?
GEORGE: I sold your clothes yesterday.
FRANK: You sold my clothes (smacks George on the forehead) what do you mean you sold my clothes?
GEORGE: I didn't think you wore them anymore.
FRANK: It's cruise wear!
ESTELLE: Kramer, I love that shirt.
KRAMER: Yaya
FRANK: THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S MINE!!
ESTELLE: You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon.
KRAMER: Oh, well, thank you.
(Estelle giggles)
FRANK: Who's this Rudy?
KRAMER: Well Rudy's the guy buying Morty's raincoats.
FRANK: Morty Seinfeld? He's a bum.
KRAMER: Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.
GEORGE: Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?
KRAMER: Yea.
GEORGE: What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?
KRAMER: Well I suppose they are wasted.
GEORGE: Yes I suppose they are.
FRANK: Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes.
KRAMER: A mouse!
(Frank starts making noises; Kramer and Frank both run to the other room where they get stuff in between the door and wall; Frank hits Kramer to get him in then closes the door)
[Monk's]
(Jerry and George enter)
JERRY: You want the tickets?
GEORGE: Yes.
JERRY: You're gonna take this kid to Paris?
GEORGE: Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I mail my own postcards.
JERRY: You know I'm paying for these tickets.
GEORGE: It's alright, I got lunch.
[Airport]
(Kramer, Morty and Jerry standing at a luggage carousel)
KRAMER: Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Paella was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?
MORTY: Not really.
KRAMER: Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm
JERRY: Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?
MORTY: This is it.
KRAMER: So how much are we gonna make?
MORTY: Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations.
KRAMER: Wha two thousand? Three thousand?
MORTY: That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item.
KRAMER: More? More than three thousand?
MORTY: Just watch me do my thing.
JERRY: Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to an open box) isn't that one of yours?
MORTY: Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape it, he just flipped the flaps. (Kramer, Morty and Jerry are looking around grabbing raincoats which are scattered all over the place.) Kramer you missed a couple.
WOMAN: Bon-jour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight.
JERRY: (turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isn't that your charter group?
(George and Joey enter the scene getting in line for the Charter Flight)
GEORGE: Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night.
JOEY: Hey! I got news for you four eyes, there's no way you're staying with us in Paris.
(Joey walks by George to board the plane and puts his Gum on the wall.)
[Rudy's Antique Boutique]
FRANK: You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn.
RUDY: Who are you anyways?
FRANK: I'm the father.
RUDY: He said his father was dead.
FRANK: He said I was dead?
RUDY: That's right. Squeezed an extra twenty-five dollars out of me.
FRANK: That's what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars.
(Kramer and Morty enter with a bunch of raincoats)
KRAMER: Hey, Frank!
FRANK: Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting our dinner invitation.
MORTY: Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.
FRANK: I'm retracting that it was ever offered.
MORTY: I retract your retraction.
FRANK: Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours?
MORTY: Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here.
RUDY: You can keep your raincoats. I'm not interested.
KRAMER: I thought we had a deal?
FRANK: That's another one of my shirts!!
RUDY: I'm not buying anymore clothes from anyone off the street.
MORTY: Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five years.
RUDY: Ya how do I know there aren't moths like his stuff?
FRANK: My clothes don't have moths!
MORTY: Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?
RUDY: That's right.
KRAMER: (laughing) I'm all ticklish. (a moth flies out of his shirt; they all look at it)
[Airport]
(Morty and Helen with a couple bags; Jerry, Elaine and Aaron saying good-bye)
ANNOUNCEMENT: Flight-433 now boarding for Miami, Gate 18a. Flight-433 now boarding.
MORTY: Ok, let's go.
HELEN: (to Aaron) It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off.
AARON: Are you sure you can't stay a little longer?
ELAINE & JERRY: NO.
MORTY: Ah, good-bye.
(Jerry hugs Morty; Helen and Elaine give each other a kiss)
ELAINE: Good-bye
JERRY: Take care
MORTY: Alright Jer.
(Morty and Elaine hug; Jerry and Helen give each other a kiss)
ELAINE: Nice to see..
MORTY: Buh bye Elaine
JERRY: Buh bye.
HELEN: Buh bye.
(Aaron torn by emotion moves in and gives Morty and Helen a hug a hug)
HELEN: (looking at Jerry while being overly hugged by Aaron) We'll call you when we get home.
AARON: Thank you.
JERRY: I think she meant me, but.
MORTY: Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.
JERRY: Ok.
(Morty and Helen go to board the plane)
ELAINE: Bye.
JERRY: Bye.
(Aaron begins to follow them)
ELAINE: Aaron? Aaron are you ok?
AARON: I could've done more. I could've done so much more.
ELAINE: You did enough.
AARON: (turning toward her) No, I could've called the travel agency, got them on another flight to Paris, I coulda got them out.
JERRY: You tried Aaron, it was too expensive.
AARON: (holds his arm up) This watch, this watch could've paid for their whole trip. (holds his other hand up) This ring, this ring is one more dinner I could've taken them out to. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other like he's crazy) Water, they need some water (turns around and runs to the Flight Agent)
ELAINE: Why?
AARON: (to the Flight Agent) They'll get dehydrated on the plane! Get the Seinfelds some water. Please! Please!
(Jerry and Elaine continue to look at him funny)
[Rachel's Parents' Place]
(Jerry knocks on the door; Mr. Goldstein answers)
JERRY: Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm afraid Rachel's not going to be able to see you tonight, or any other night for that matter.
JERRY: Why what did I do?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: (Rachel is know seen behind her Dad) You know very well. I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night it was disgraceful. You should be ashamed of yourself, I for one will not allow my daughter to be involved with someone of such weak moral fiber. Fortunately my postman happened to have witnessed the entire incident. A heavy set fellow, I believe he lives in your building. (Jerry turns to almost do a 'Newman') Now if you don't mind. (starts to close the door)
JERRY: Rachel!
MR. GOLDSTEIN: (closing the door on Jerry) Good night!
JERRY: Rachel!
[Monk's]
(Jerry and Elaine at the normal booth)
JERRY: So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything.
ELAINE: Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen?
JERRY: The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.
ELAINE: Oohh, boy. They could use a vacation.
JERRY: Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.
ELAINE: (sighs) So how about that Aaron?
JERRY: Whew
ELAINE: You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?
JERRY: No I hadn't noticed.
(Newman enters and walks by the table; Jerry doesn't notice him as he is getting something out of his coat pocket)
NEWMAN: (at the counter) Pair of bear claws please.
JERRY: (hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman.
NEWMAN: (moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello Jerry.
JERRY: Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.
NEWMAN: Ohh, were you there?
JERRY: Yes I was.
NEWMAN: (looking scared) I-it's a it's a...powerful film.
JERRY: Yes, shocking brutality don't you think?
NEWMAN: (couple quick breaths) Shocking.
JERRY: Yes, well that was nothing.
(Newman makes a noise and takes off toward the door as Jerry gets up)
NEWMAN: (running out the door) Jerry! Jerry!
(Jerry chases Newman right out the door)
[Paris]
(George is sitting at an outside eatery in France with Joey)
GEORGE: Where the hell is your father?!
(George smiles and waves at a girl sitting at another table; Joey puts some stuff on George's glasses)
[Cruise ship out in the Ocean]
(Estelle and Frank walking around on the boat)
ESTELLE: This is the best thing we ever did.
FRANK: I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing.
ESTELLE: Ah forget about them let's just...
(Frank and Estelle run into Morty and Helen)
[Closing Monologue]
Personal distance is a very important thing. There's a new personal distance, ATM distance. When someone's using an ATM, you wanna be about six feet back don't you? Because people a little edgy around that ATM don't they? They got their money out, their eyes are darting all around. The other place I wanna be about six feet away is Urinals, you want some distance there too. ATMs and Urinals, I guess whenever someone's taking valuable out of their pants you want to give them as much room as possible.
[Opening Monologue]
To me, the thing about birthday parties is that the first birthday party you have and the last birthday party you have are actually quite similar. You know, you just kinda sit there...you're the least excited person at the party. You don't even really realize that there is a party. You don't know what's goin' on. Both birthday parties, people have to kinda help you blow out the candles, you can't do it...you don't even know why you're doing it. What is this ritual? What is going on? It's also the only two birthday parties where other people have to gather your friends together for you. Sometimes they're not even your friends. They make the judgement. They bring 'em in, they sit 'em down, and they tell you - 'these are your friends! Tell them thank you for coming to my birthday party.'
[Elaine's Office at Pendant]
(Elaine, Kramer, and Kramer's excitable girlfriend Toby looking at proofs for Kramer's "coffee table book about coffee tables.")
TOBY (exuberantly): These are great! Just great! Really great! Really, really great! Don't you think so, Elaine?
ELAINE (put off by Toby's exuberance): Yeah, really great.
TOBY: Oh, a coffee table book about coffee tables! (To Kramer) How did you come up with this idea?
KRAMER: It was there!
TOBY: Oh, look at this one! It's saying, 'I'm a coffee table, put some coffee on me! Oh, the hotter the better, that's what I'm here for!' (laughs)
ELAINE: You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...
KRAMER: Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?
TOBY: Ohhh, that is a great idea! Really, really great!
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Elaine and Jerry later that day.)
ELAINE (imitating Toby): 'Oooh, and that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from "The Price Is Right"! (demonstrates a winner on "The Price Is Right")
JERRY: Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) "Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."
ELAINE (uninterested): Yeah, it's funny, I dunno.
JERRY: You don't know? Come on, that's gold!
ELAINE: Well, I don't know about "gold."
JERRY: Oh, that's gold, baby.
ELAINE: 'Baby'? What, are you doing George now?
JERRY: I was saying 'baby' way before George!
ELAINE: Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it just puts too much pressure on me.
JERRY: Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.
ELAINE: Yeah, who's he?
JERRY: He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly . I would like to have a good show.
(Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: Danke schoen, my little dumplings.
ELAINE: Hi.
KRAMER (to Elaine): Hey, how about that Toby, huh?
ELAINE: Yeah, how about her?
KRAMER: Ooh, she's a package full of energy!
ELAINE: Yeah, she's a package full of something.
KRAMER: Yeah, and that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity!
ELAINE (absolutely disgusted): Oh, pleeeeease. (moves to the living room and sits down)
KRAMER (to Jerry): Hey, are you performing tomorrow?
JERRY: Yeah.
KRAMER: Great, I'm gonna bring Toby.
JERRY: Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
KRAMER: Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?
ELAINE: Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. (imitates Toby) Really, really great!
JERRY (to Kramer): Well, you want to sit with George? I think he's coming with Robin.
KRAMER: Is that the waitress from the comedy club?
JERRY: Yeah.
KRAMER: Oh.
ELAINE: What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?
KRAMER: She's got a kid?
JERRY: Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!
[Monk's]
(George and Robin in a booth. Robin's kid is under the table.)
GEORGE: Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat that! That's not food! (to Robin) He's suckin' down Equal packets!
ROBIN: Do you think 25 kids is too much?
GEORGE: 25 kids for his birthday party? (to kid under table) Don't put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, here, have some more sugar packets. (tosses some Equal packets under the table)
ROBIN: So, what about entertainment? (to kid) Should I get Barney?
KID: No Barney!
ROBIN (to George): Maybe a clown.
GEORGE: How about Bozo?
KID: Who's Bozo?
GEORGE: Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none.
ROBIN: George...
GEORGE: With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles...
ROBIN: George...
GEORGE: He had a TV show! He had cartoons!
ROBIN: George! Forget Bozo, George. Bozo's out. He's finished. It's over for Bozo.
GEORGE: You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties w-with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party...
(Flashback of George at seven, sitting in front of a birthday cake with a shocked expression on his face, while Frank and Estelle scream at him)
FRANK: Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles!
ESTELLE: Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!
FRANK: Blow out the candles!!
(Return from flashback)
ROBIN: Well, this time, you can blow out the candles.
GEORGE: Nah, I have asthma. (Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under the table, and George struggles.)
[Elaine's office at Pendant]
(Toby enters)
TOBY: Hi!
ELAINE (in a dreadful tone): Hi, Toby.
TOBY: How are you doing today?
ELAINE: Fine... (Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.) How are you?
TOBY: Oh, I'm great! Just great. Really great! Oh, hey - did you hear about Bob Rosen?
ELAINE: Nope.
TOBY: He is going to Knopp. He is going to be a vice president.
ELAINE: Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?
TOBY: No. I hear he wants to promote someone in-house.
ELAINE: Really!?
TOBY: Maybe it'll be you!
ELAINE: Oh...well...
TOBY: You really deserve it. I mean, you have experience, seniority...Lippman really respects your opinion...
ELAINE (beaming): Well! Well, it could be you.
TOBY: No...
ELAINE: No, really.
TOBY (standing): Really? You think so?
ELAINE (humoring her): Sure.
TOBY: Boy, wouldn't that be exciting!
ELAINE: I mean, stranger things have happened...
TOBY: Wow! Me! A senior editor! (deadly serious) I'd like that.
ELAINE: Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby.
TOBY: Well, it's a possibility, like you said! Stranger things have happened! Thank you, Elaine. Thank you. (Exits.)
[Comedy Club]
(Jerry and Ronnie the Prop Comic backstage)
JERRY: Hey, Ronnie.
RONNIE: Hey.
JERRY: (To bartender) Can I have a club soda? (To Ronnie) Goin' on tonight?
RONNIE: Yeah. You?
JERRY: Yeah.
RONNIE: You know Leonard Christian's here?
JERRY: Yeah, I know.
RONNIE: Can I ask you something? Are my nostrils getting bigger?
JERRY: (looking at his nostrils) I don't...think so.
RONNIE: Are you sure? Take a good look. They seem a little bigger?
JERRY: I don't...I dunno.
RONNIE: Is it possible for nostrils to expand?
JERRY: Oh, is this a bit?
RONNIE: Hey, I don't do "bits." I'm a prop comic. Dammit, I can't find my water gun. I can't go on without my water gun.
(Kramer and Toby enter.)
KRAMER: Hey, Jerry.
JERRY: (turns to greet Kramer) Hey.
KRAMER: Well here's Toby, (points to Jerry in order to introduce him to Toby) Jerry.
TOBY: This is so exciting! Look, I have goosebumps! (To Jerry) Touch! Touch them! (Jerry touches her arm. Toby screeches with excitement.) I've never been to a comedy club before!
JERRY: Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too.
TOBY (laughing): You are so funny!
JERRY: Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.
TOBY: Oh! He swears like he thinks I don't believe him. I believe you. I believe you! Oh, he's so funny! (laughs)
KRAMER: What about me?
TOBY (serious): What about you? (laughs) I'm only kidding. You're funny, too. I love to laugh.
JERRY: Good, good.
KRAMER (to Jerry): So, you up next?
JERRY: Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?
TOBY: Oh yeah, we don't want some jerk sitting in front of us, it'll be like, 'Hey, big head, can you move out of the way? I didn't pay a cover charge to stare at your bald spot.' (laughs)
KRAMER: Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?
JERRY: Yeah.
TOBY: Oh, have a great show. Hey, we'll make sure it's a great show!
JERRY: O.k., good, I'll see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.)
TOBY: Oh, he's so great! This is so great! I'm so excited!
(Cut to Jerry on stage. Toby and Kramer are sitting in the audience near the front.)
JERRY: Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...
TOBY (loudly): Oh, really! Really! That is so true!
JERRY: Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.
TOBY: Yes! Yes! Right on! Right on! (Other audience members give her puzzled looks.)
JERRY (attempting to carry on despite Toby's interruptions): See...women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel...
TOBY: Oh, that is so true, yes!
JERRY: ...that's why men hunt and women nest.
TOBY: BOO! BOO! Hiss! Boo! (Toby's obnoxious behavior causes Jerry to completely lose his place and mess up his act.)
JERRY: Yea, ya, so...anyway what was I talking about.
[Jerry pacing the floor backstage after his act. Kramer enters.]
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!
KRAMER: Look, she didn't mean anything.
JERRY: Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!
KRAMER: She's just being enthusiastic, that's all!
(Toby enters.)
JERRY: Hey! What is wrong with you?!
TOBY: Me? Nothing's wrong with me.
JERRY: Y-You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set!
TOBY: Oh, come on! I thought you're a pro! That's part of the show.
JERRY: No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!
TOBY: Well, that's the way I express myself. How are you gonna make it in this business if you can't take it?
JERRY: Oh, I can take it.
TOBY (to Kramer): Let's go. (Ronnie walks by Jerry.)
RONNIE: Hey, man. Good set.
[George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.]
GEORGE: Bozo?
ERIC: No.
GEORGE: B-O-Z-O?
ERIC: Sorry, I...
GEORGE: You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?
ERIC: No!
GEORGE: How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?
ERIC: I don't know, I just don't.
GEORGE: How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?
ERIC: Hey, man - what are you hassling me for? This is just a gig, it's not my life. I don't know who Bozo is, what - is he a clown?
GEORGE: Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?
ERIC: Well, what is he?
GEORGE: Yes, he's a clown!
ERIC: Alright, so what's the big deal! There's millions of clowns!
GEORGE: Alright, just forget it.
ERIC: Me forget it? You should forget it! You're livin' in the past, man! You're hung up on some clown from the sixties, man!
GEORGE: Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric! (chuckles) What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?
ROBIN'S MOTHER: Excuse me...you must be George! I'm Robin's mother. Oh, you seem like such a lovely young man!
GEORGE: Well, I do what I can. (Robin comes over.)
ROBIN: Hi Mom, how's everything?
ROBIN'S MOTHER: Oh, this is just a wonderful party!
ROBIN: The burgers should be ready in a minute.
GEORGE: Ah, great, great. (sniffs) What's that smell? Smoke? (walks to the kitchen) Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!
(The kids all scream and the party goes crazy. George barrels out of the kitchen, pushing down kids, clowns and old ladies in a mad panic to escape. He runs out the door and leaves everyone behind.)
(Cut to George sitting in the back of an ambulance with an oxygen mask on his face.)
GEORGE (to the EMTs): It was an inferno in there! An inferno! (Eric, Robin's mother, and all the kids rush at George.)
ERIC: There he is! That's him! (Tries to clobber George with his big shoe.)
ROBIN'S MOTHER: That's the coward that left us to die!
(Cut to George attempting to explain his cowardly actions to Robin, her mother, Eric and a fireman from the back of the ambulance at the party.)
GEORGE (voice is hoarse from screaming): I...was trying to lead the way. We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety.
ROBIN: But you yelled "get out of my way"!
GEORGE: Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?
ROBIN: But I saw you push the women and children out of the way in a mad panic! I saw you knock them down! And when you ran out, you left everyone behind!
GEORGE: Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?
FIREMAN: How do you live with yourself?
GEORGE: Its not easy.
[Monk's]
(George and Jerry at the usual booth)
GEORGE: So she doesn't want to see me anymore.
JERRY: Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?
GEORGE: No, her too. And her mother.
JERRY: Really? Her mother.
GEORGE: Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.
JERRY: You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
GEORGE: Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.
JERRY: Hmm. So you feel "women and children first," in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.
GEORGE: To some degree.
JERRY: So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.
GEORGE: In a manner of speaking.
JERRY: Yeah, well, it's honest.
GEORGE: Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.
JERRY: Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.
GEORGE: Perhaps.
JERRY: So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?
GEORGE: Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.
JERRY: By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine)
GEORGE: What's that?
JERRY: It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.
GEORGE: Wow, he really does a number on you. (reads) "Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling."
JERRY: I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
GEORGE: You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.
JERRY: Yeah, right.
GEORGE: You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'
JERRY: Yeah, that'd be something.
GEORGE: I'm not kidding, you should do it.
JERRY: But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.
GEORGE: Well, go ahead! Do it!
JERRY: Why can't I?
GEORGE: No reason!
JERRY: You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!
GEORGE: This is unprecedented!
JERRY: There's no precedent, baby!
GEORGE: What...are you using my babies now?
[Toby in her office at Pendant.]
(Jerry pokes his head in the door.)
JERRY: Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'
TOBY: You know, I have work to do here! I'm very busy!
JERRY: Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?
TOBY: Well, how would you like it if I called security?
JERRY: Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!
TOBY: No, (gets up out of her chair) that's it. (Kramer arrives; to Kramer) Get out of the way.
(Toby upset; storms out.)
KRAMER: Hey, what's going on?
JERRY: Boo!
KRAMER: What's happenin' here?
JERRY: Hiss!
KRAMER: (going after Toby) Toby! Toby!
(Cut to a scene of the street outside. We hear screeching tires)
TOBY: (voice; screaming) My pinky toe!
KRAMER: (voice; yelling) Toby! (Shot of a shocked Kramer is shown) Oh, Oh!
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Kramer and Jerry)
KRAMER: What did you go up there to heckle her for?
JERRY: Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.)
KRAMER: Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.
JERRY: Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.
GEORGE: What accident?
KRAMER: Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.
GEORGE: That's unbelievable!
KRAMER: Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.
GEORGE: Wha.. you ran?
KRAMER: No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, "I got a toe here, buddy - step on it."
GEORGE: Holy cow!
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, "Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?" I said, "Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - " (Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold!
GEORGE: How could you do that?!
KRAMER: Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.
GEORGE: You're Batman.
KRAMER: Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know - at the next stop.
JERRY: You kept makin' all the stops?
KRAMER: Well, people kept ringin' the bell!
GEORGE: Well, wha-what about the toe? What happened to the toe?
KRAMER: Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.
GEORGE: You did all this...for a pinky toe?
KRAMER: Well, it's a valuable appendage.
[Elaine's office at Pendant]
(Elaine talking with two co-workers.)
JOANNE: So, Kramer found the toe, and they re-attached it.
ELAINE: Really.
JOANNE: Yea, poor kid. What an ordeal.
MICHAEL: And you know how extremely sensitive she is?
ELAINE: I know.
MICHAEL: She's gonna need our full support.
ELAINE (wearily): Yeah, right.
OTHER CO-WORKERS IN HALLWAY: Look who's here! Toby! (Toby enters on crutches.)
MICHAEL: Toby, what can I do? Can I get you something?
TOBY: Oh no, no thank you.
MICHAEL: Toby please let us help. We're family.
TOBY: Oh well, I could use some coffee.
(A horde of employees flood into Elaine's office to gush over Toby. Elaine is pushed to the floor as a result.)
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Elaine and Jerry)
JERRY: She got the promotion?
ELAINE (standing in the doorway): Yep.
JERRY: Why?
ELAINE: I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.
JERRY: Too bad.
ELAINE: Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?
JERRY: Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'
ELAINE: Why don't you just shut the f-
KRAMER (from his doorway): Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted!
ELAINE: Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??
KRAMER: Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.
ELAINE: Oh, wonderful!
KRAMER: You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.
ELAINE: Oh, of course! She's deranged.
[Jerry and Ronnie backstage at the comedy club.]
JERRY: I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.
RONNIE: I heard you went down to somebody's office and heckled them?
JERRY: Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough!
RONNIE: How could you do that? I mean, everybody's talking about it.
JERRY: Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.
RONNIE: Jerry, you're like Rosa Parks. You opened the door for all of us. I can't wait till the next time someone heckles me.
JERRY: Yeah, well, it won't be long.
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jerry Seinfeld!
JERRY: Gotta go. (heads out on stage)
(George enters and sees Robin working.)
GEORGE: Robin? Robin!
ROBIN: George, what is it? I'm working.
GEORGE: Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.
ROBIN: What are you talking about?
GEORGE: O.k....(is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.)
JERRY: I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need "the clown" in his title, as clown? Bozo, "the" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...
(Cut back to George explaining his situation to Robin.)
GEORGE: ...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance.
ROBIN: L-listen, Listen...I gotta think about this. (walks away.)
GEORGE: Alright, but I'm serious about this.
RONNIE (points his water gun at the bartender): Alright, hand it over man!
(Cut back to Jerry onstage.)
JERRY: ...that's why men hunt and women nest.
GEORGE (from backstage): He's got a gun! He's got a gun! Get out of the way! (Tries to flee the bar in a mad panic. The audience in the club also goes nuts and heads for the exits. Jerry stands onstage, perplexed.)
(Cut back to George in the bar.)
ROBIN: George! This is Ronnie Kaye!
GEORGE: The prop comic? (Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.) Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?
RONNIE (points to his nose): Nostrils.
(Jerry comes backstage.)
JERRY: George - could I have a word?
[Closing Monologue]
I was in a hotel room the other day, and on the back of the door in the hotel room they have the fire map. I'm flattered that they think I have it together enough to stand in a burning hotel room memorizing directions. 'Yeah, I'll go left by the stairs, right by the candy machine...' I'd probably get lost, have to go back to the room, check the map again...and they always tell you, no matter what, whatever you do in a hotel fire - do not panic. Hey, I got four minutes to live, I've never panicked in my whole life - it's my option. Even if they find you, you have a perfect excuse...'Gee, I heard they saved you swingin' from the shower curtain naked with an ice bucket on your head. What happened there?' 'Well, I panicked.' 'That's understandable.'
[Opening Monologue]
I find the human fascination with water is amazing. We're constantly going to beaches, pools, lakes, rivers, we're swimming, we're snorkeling, we're-we're scuba diving, we bathe in it, our bodies are mostly made of water, everyone is caring around these bottles of water. We can't get enough water, unless it rains then we're like, "Oh, look I'm soaked. I am literally drenched." For some reason we have a huge problem with small flying water. I-It'll just stop us right in our tracks. "Uh, I felt a drop, We're gonna get caught in it! Everyone cover your water bottles, run!!"
[Jerry's Car]
(Jerry driving, with Elaine in passenger seat and Kramer in back seat)
KRAMER: All right, get off at the next exit.
JERRY: Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit.
KRAMER: It's a great house, pool, sun deck? Yeah, I'll be there.
JERRY: (To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?
ELAINE: We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.
JERRY: Didn't they just have a baby?
ELAINE: That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'
JERRY: Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
KRAMER: Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?
JERRY: No.
KRAMER: Put that on the top of your list.
JERRY: No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.
ELAINE: Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together?
JERRY: I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.
ELAINE: When's Rachel comin' out?
JERRY: She's makin' the three o'clock train.
ELAINE: Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.
JERRY: I bought him some kishka.
KRAMER: What's that?
JERRY: It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.
(Elaine laughs)
[George and Jane in another car driving to the Hamptons.]
GEORGE: I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
JANE: Me too. I love cough medicine.
GEORGE: You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want.
JANE: What's your favorite?
GEORGE: Potussan. Ever try it with club soda?
JANE: No.
GEORGE: Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone.
JANE: Are we almost there?
GEORGE: Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.
JANE: What for?
GEORGE: My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.
JANE: Can you buy 'em later? I really wanna get some... sun.
[George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.]
KRAMER: Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.
JERRY: Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?
KRAMER: Come on, I'll rub some on yours.
JERRY: No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No.
GEORGE: (To Jane) You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool.
JANE: (No feeling in her voice) You must've been excited.
GEORGE: Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride?
JANE: I don't think so.
GEORGE: 'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?
JERRY: No thanks.
KRAMER: No. (George leaves for the tomatoes)
JANE: I'm gonna take a dip. (She leaves for beach, Elaine enters with a shady hat on)
JERRY: And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry)
ELAINE: Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?
JERRY: No lines.
ELAINE: You know why? One word: shade.
JERRY: So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?
ELAINE: I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
KRAMER: I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you wanna come?
ELAINE: (Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.
JERRY: (Looking toward beach) Oh this is interesting.
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: Jane's topless. (They all look)
KRAMER: Yo yo ma.
JERRY: Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
ELAINE: Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door)
CAROL: Come on, you guys. You can come and see the bay-bee!
JERRY: Oh, in a minute, Carol.
KRAMER: We're gonna be right there.
JERRY: This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
ELAINE: Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
KRAMER: Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.
ELAINE: What?
KRAMER: You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.
JERRY: Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane enters)
JANE: I'm thirsty. Anyone want a drink?
(Jerry, Elaine and Kramer are shocked)
JERRY: No thanks.
ELAINE: I'm good.
KRAMER: Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right, show's over. I'm goin' to the beach.
(Carol enters the Bay-bee's room with Elaine, Jerry, and husband Michael not far behind.)
CAROL: Adam (the baby's name), Jerry and Elaine are here.
ELAINE: Oh, he's a cute little shnugly baby.
CAROL: Isn't he gorgeous? (Elaine looks at baby, only to be frightened and turn away)
ELAINE: Ugghh.
CAROL: Is she gorgeous? (Elaine and Jerry looking away)
ELAINE: Oh, gorgeous, yes.
JERRY: So very gorgeous.
CAROL: Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in.
(Cut to Kramer on the beach with some girls, then using a metal detector, then seeing a rope leading to something he doesn't know of yet.)
(Jerry and Elaine gasping for air outside after they just left the baby's room.)
JERRY: Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
ELAINE: Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.
JERRY: Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit) And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.
ELAINE: Oh, you have to lie.
JERRY: It's a must lie situation.
ELAINE: Yes, it's a must lie situation.
JERRY: You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.
ELAINE: No, I don't think so.
JERRY: In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.
[Cut to Kramer reeling in a box of lobster on the ocean.]
KRAMER: Oooh, lobsters.
[Carol and the baby's doctor with the baby]
BEN: Oh this ointment should do it.
CAROL: How are you feeling, Adam? (She sees Elaine in the hall) Elaine! (Elaine enters) This is our pediatrician, Ben Feffa.
ELAINE: Hi.
CAROL: Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how gorgeous?
ELAINE: (Looking at Ben) Pretty gorgeous.
BEN: Elaine, you have children?
ELAINE: Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby.
BEN: A beautiful woman like you should. You're quite breathtaking.
ELAINE: Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?
CAROL: And he's very particular. Ben, you're staying tonight, right?
BEN: Uh, Sure. (Elaine celebrates to herself as Jerry enters and quickly looks away from the baby)
JERRY: Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.
ELAINE: Yeah, see ya.
JERRY: Okay. (He leaves)
CAROL: Oh, just look at him!
BEN: Yeah, he really is breathtaking. (Elaine confused by his comment)
[Jerry and Rachel outside]
RACHEL: Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the wrong way.
JERRY: Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes outside)
GEORGE: Hey Rachel!
RACHEL: (Quickly gets out of seat) Hi. I'm gonna go in there to change.
(She leaves)
GEORGE: What kind of a greeting was that?
JERRY: She's got greeting problems.
GEORGE: Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit.
JERRY: Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of lobster)
KRAMER: Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!
GEORGE: Hey! Wow, the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside)
JERRY: You got lobster for everybody?
KRAMER: Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.
GEORGE: This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for dinner...
KRAMER: I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that 'damn' expression behind George)
GEORGE: You saw who, what?
KRAMER: Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.
JERRY: (Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.
GEORGE: You saw Jane topless?
JERRY: Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.
GEORGE: Oh you mean face down on her chest.
JERRY: No.
GEORGE: Face up on her back?
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: Well why'd she do that?
KRAMER: I guess she was hot.
GEORGE: You mean she just laid there topless?
KRAMER: No, no, she got up, she walked around...
GEORGE: Walked around? And you looked?
KRAMER: Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'll be right back.
GEORGE: I can't believe that you saw her before me.
JERRY: Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)
GEORGE: Well, how good a look did you get?
JERRY: Well what'd you mean?
GEORGE: Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...
JERRY: They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
GEORGE: Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked.
JERRY: (looking of into the distance) I guess that's true...
GEORGE: Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit.
JERRY: What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?
GEORGE: Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.
JERRY: You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
GEORGE: It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.
[Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well]
ELAINE: Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.
JERRY: I've never been called breathtaking either.
ELAINE: I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?
JERRY: Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
ELAINE: Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.
JERRY: How are you gonna do that?
ELAINE: I can be very clever.
RACHEL: I'm gonna take a swim.
ELAINE: Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees George) Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.
GEORGE: Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room and goes in)
RACHEL: Hey!
GEORGE: Oh, sorry.
RACHEL: Don't you knock?
GEORGE: I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before.
JERRY: You might have.
GEORGE: I didn't.
JERRY: You won't.
RACHEL: What'd you want anyway, George?
JERRY: Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?
GEORGE: No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.
JERRY: Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.
GEORGE: Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.
RACHEL: We don't have any gum.
GEORGE: Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits)
RACHEL: Strange man.
JERRY: Wait'll you get to know him.
RACHEL: So where is this baby, anyway?
JERRY: Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)
RACHEL: (She screams) Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's room. I'm really sorry. (She exits)
GEORGE: (realizing he was short changed) I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
[Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room]
GEORGE: Did she do it on purpose?
JERRY: It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.
GEORGE: I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
JERRY: So what?
GEORGE: Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...
JERRY: But...
GEORGE: Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...
JERRY: Oh... You mean... shrinkage.
GEORGE: Yes. Significant shrinkage.
JERRY: So you feel you were short changed.
GEORGE: Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.
JERRY: Well, so what's the difference?
GEORGE: What if she discusses it with Jane?
JERRY: Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.
GEORGE: How do you know?
JERRY: Women aren't like us.
GEORGE: They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?
JERRY: No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
GEORGE: How do women know about shrinkage?
JERRY: Isn't it common knowledge?
GEORGE & JERRY: (Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
GEORGE: Do women know about shrinkage?
ELAINE: What do you mean, like laundry?
GEORGE: No.
JERRY: Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...
ELAINE: It shrinks?
JERRY: Like a frightened turtle!
ELAINE: Why does it shrink?
GEORGE: It just does.
ELAINE: I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
[Everyone at the dinner table eating Kramer's lobster.]
MICHAEL: Thanks for the lobster, Kramer.
KRAMER: Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?
RACHEL: Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish.
KRAMER: You mean you've never tasted lobster?
RACHEL: No.
KRAMER: Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you die, you're gonna get some special attention.
(Baby is heard crying)
CAROL: Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with us.
ELAINE & JERRY: No!
JERRY: No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.
ELAINE: Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here. We're-We're not fun for a baby.
JERRY: Yeah, the lobster'll scare him.
CAROL: I'm gonna get him.
GEORGE: See, look at this. (wearing a very tight shirt) Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things.
ELAINE: Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's ear, which prompts Jane to laugh)
GEORGE: What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at?
JANE: It's nothing, George.
GEORGE: You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?
JANE: What is it with you?
JERRY: (To George) Easy big fella.
MICHAEL: So Kramer, where'd you get all these lobster, at the Fleesher's Market?
KRAMER: No, I got 'em in the ocean.
MICHAEL: The ocean? What'd you mean?
KRAMER: Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up.
MICHAEL: Those are commercial lobster traps. You can't take those lobsters from there. That's against the law.
KRAMER: Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.
MICHAEL: My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at four and came home every night stinking of brine! He sent me through law school with the lobsters he caught! (Kramer stands up from table)
CAROL: (Entering with baby) Here he is.
KRAMER: Ahhh! (Shocked after seeing the baby)
[Out on the porch, Ben and Elaine]
ELAINE: Some night, huh?
BEN: Yeah, I wish I had my telescope.
ELAINE: Some dinner, huh?
BEN: Nothing like fresh caught lobster.
ELAINE: Some house, huh?
BEN: It was built by Mark Fargman. He build a lot of these homes here.
ELAINE: Some ugly baby, huh?
BEN: What did you say?
ELAINE: (improvising) I said, uh, some snuggly baby.
BEN: He is something.
ELAINE: Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.
BEN: Well, you know Elaine, sometimes you say things just to be nice. (Elaine relieved, then confused, not knowing if he was being nice to her or to the baby)
[Rachel and Jerry in their room]
JERRY: You told her?
RACHEL: Yeah, what's the big deal?
JERRY: You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.
RACHEL: Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed with this stuff, not us. I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane.
[In Jane & George's room, Jane is packing her things]
GEORGE: You're going back to New York now?
JANE: Yeah, I have some things to do.
GEORGE: Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think.
JANE: So what if I did?
GEORGE: And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?
JANE: I don't know what you're talking about.
GEORGE: *I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and *more*!
JANE: (patronizing George) I'm sure it is.
GEORGE: Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage.
[Rachel enters the kitchen with Kramer sitting at table. Rachel opens fridge and Kramer lights up a cigar]
KRAMER: You looking for this? (Holding up lobster)
RACHEL: Oh, Kramer! You startled me.
KRAMER: Well, I thought you might wind up around here.
RACHEL: Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone was enjoying the lobster so much an' well I thought I little taste wouldn't hurt, huh?
KRAMER: No I'm afraid I couldn't do that.
RACHEL: Why not?
KRAMER: Well, that wouldn't be kosher.
RACHEL: C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it.
KRAMER: Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.
RACHEL: Come on, Kramer.
KRAMER: Heyahhh!
[Rachel walks back into Jerry's bedroom.]
RACHEL: I just heard a car drive out. What was that?
JERRY: Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. (Rachel shocked)
[Breakfast table the next morning, George cooking]
CAROL: George, thanks so much for making breakfast.
ELAINE: George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.
KRAMER: Ya I didn't know you could cook.
GEORGE: Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.
BEN: Yes, George, the whole breakfast is breathtaking. (hearing this Elaine looks at him extremely annoyed)
(Rachel and Jerry enter)
RACHEL: Good morning.
ALL: Hey, hey. Morning
RACHEL: Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, you really saved me.
MICHAEL: What happened?
RACHEL: Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me.
KRAMER: Well I knew you'd regret it for the rest of your life.
RACHEL: You're right, I would have.
JERRY: (Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.
GEORGE: A little breakfast.
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: (To Rachel) And, uh, you eat eggs, right?
RACHEL: Yes, I do. Thank you.
JERRY: Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?
RACHEL: Umm... This is so good.
GEORGE: Ah, enjoying them?
RACHEL: Mm-hmm.
GEORGE: Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of these. (Holds up lobster bib)
RACHEL: There's lobster in these eggs?
GEORGE: Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.
(Rachel storms out of room)
JERRY: Well, I guess I gotta go, too.
ELAINE: Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman knocks on door, Michael answers)
MICHAEL: Excuse me?
POLICE: I'm sorry to bother you, but we're trying to track down a lobster poacher that uh cleaned out on of the traps.
KRAMER: Wonder what's goin' on.
GEORGE: Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize.
MICHAEL: There he is, officer. (Michael points to Kramer, Kramer waves to policeman)
[George walks into Jerry and Rachel's room]
RACHEL: Ahh! Don't you ever knock?
[Jerry, Elaine, and George in the car.]
GEORGE: I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.
ELAINE: Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either.
JERRY: I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
ELAINE: How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?
JERRY: They got some sort of program.
[Cut to Kramer picks up trash on the side of the road, watched by a police officer.]
[Back to the car with Jerry, Elaine and George]
GEORGE: Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more.
JERRY: Hey, isn't that Michael's car?
ELAINE: There's Rachel.
GEORGE: Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato)
[Closing Monologue]
Look at the work that people will do to get to the ocean. They'll fight the traffic and the heat and the parking and the hot sand. Trying to get through the waves, and the ironic thing is the ocean doesn't even really want us in there. That's what surfing is. Surfing is the ocean throwing us out of itself, you see? We keep trying to paddle in, the ocean's saying, "No you don't." The ocean is like a nightclub and the waves are bouncers tossin' us out. The undertow's like a really mean bouncer. Instead of throwin' you out, they take you in back and rough you up a little bit. "Oh, you wanna come in? How 'bout comin' in like 25 miles?"
[Opening monologue]
It seems pretty hard to justify, at this point in human history, the existence of men and their handkerchiefs. I mean, they open it up, blow their nose in it, and then put it back in their pockets with their other valuables. Wallet, keys, mucous, yup, got everything. Is it because men can't give birth that they're just proud of anything that comes out of us? Well, actually have a monogram sewn on to it. What is the source of pride here? We-ah-uh, sticking out of the breast pocket of our jacket. 'I have a snot rag.'
[A sad-looking George staring out at the ocean.]
[Mr. Lippman's Office at Pendant]
(Elaine and Mr. Lippman are toasting in champagne)
MR. LIPPMAN: To your promotion.
ELAINE: Oh, thank you! (They drink) Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.
MR. LIPPMAN: Well, you're really on your way now.
(Elaine screams with joy and Mr. Lippman coughs violently)
ELAINE: You really oughtta do something about that cold.
[Monk's]
(Jerry and Elaine at the normal booth)
JERRY: You got a raise?
ELAINE: I don't fool around, (banging on the table) baby!
JERRY: I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
ELAINE: They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.
JERRY: Oh, when did that happen?
ELAINE: They're signing the papers next week.
JERRY: Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
ELAINE: Yeah, they'll definitely do it now.
JERRY: Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.
ELAINE: Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.
JERRY: Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen "Girlie" Brown would be very proud of you.
(Enter George)
JERRY: Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
GEORGE: I went to the beach. (Jerry and Elaine exchange looks)
JERRY: Oh, the beach.
(Elaine laughs)
GEORGE: It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working. (sits down next to Elaine)
JERRY: What is it that isn't working?
GEORGE: Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. (Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh, maybe not academically speaking, (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.
JERRY: (pointing to napkins; to Elaine) Could I get napkin over there?
GEORGE: It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong. (chuckles) Everywhere.
(A waitress comes up to George)
WAITRESS : Tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee.
GEORGE: Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs)
ELAINE: Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.
JERRY: You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it)
GEORGE: (annoyed) Good for the tuna.
(A blonde looks at George)
ELAINE: Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.
GEORGE: So what? What am I supposed to do?
ELAINE: Go talk to her.
GEORGE: Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.
JERRY: Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.
GEORGE: Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.
JERRY: If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
GEORGE: Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!
(He goes over to the woman)
GEORGE: Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.
VICTORIA: Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch as me.
(George takes a deep breath)
GEORGE: My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.
VICTORIA: I'm Victoria. Hi.
(George amazed at her response turns and looks toward Jerry and Elaine who are off screen)
[Jerry's apartment]
JERRY: (on the phone) Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye. (hangs up the phone)
(Enter Kramer)
KRAMER: Hey. Buddy, it's all happening!
JERRY: What's happening?
KRAMER: The coffee table book. It's a go-oo!
JERRY: Oh yeah, I heard all about it.
KRAMER: You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop : Regis and Kathy Lee.
JERRY: You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?
KRAMER: Oh, you better believe it!
JERRY: I'll loan you my puffy shirt.
KRAMER: No, no, no.
JERRY: What're you gonna talk about?
KRAMER: Well, coffee tables.
(The phone rings)
JERRY: Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye. (hangs up the phone; turns to Kramer) You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.
KRAMER: You know who you are? Even Steven
[George's car]
(George and Victoria)
VICTORIA: Are you growing a beard?
GEORGE: Why shave every day? It just grows right back.
VICTORIA: I guess ...
GEORGE: I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.
(A car cuts in in front of them, George has to make a sudden maneuver)
VICTORIA: Hey watch, he just cut you off! Did you see that?!
GEORGE: Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.
[Movie Theater]
(two young men are sitting behind George and Victoria)
MAN #1 : Hey baby, how about a little tongue action, huh?
MAN #2 : Yeah, stick your tongue down his throat!
(Both laughing, they kick George and Victoria's seats)
VICTORIA: What are we gonna do? Should we just move?
GEORGE: That won't be necessary.
(Both men are still laughing very loudly; George gets up and turns towards the two men)
GEORGE: Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!
(People applaud as George sits down again)
[George's car]
VICTORIA: Are you sure you don't wanna come up, I mean, it's only nine thirty.
GEORGE: I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.
VICTORIA: Who are you, George Costanza?
GEORGE: I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.
[Movie Theater
(Elaine is in the lobby)
THEATER MANAGER: Excuse me, is your name Elaine?
ELAINE: Yes.
THEATER MANAGER: Were you suposed to meet a Jake Jarmal here?
ELAINE: Yeah.
THEATER MANAGER: Well, I'm afraid he's been in an accident.
ELAINE: (gasp) An accident? What happened?
THEATER MANAGER: Well-he got side-swiped by a cab, but he's alright. He's in St.Vincent Hospital, room 907.
ELAINE: Oh. Ok. Thank you.
(She starts to leave, but changes her mind and goes back to the counter)
ELAINE: Could I have a box of Jujyfruits?
COUNTERPERSON: (handing the Jujyfruits to Elaine) There you go.
[Hospital]
(Elaine with Jake in his room)
JAKE: So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip.
ELAINE: (With her mouth full of Jujyfruit) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.
(Jake looks at Elaine eating)
ELAINE: You want one?
JAKE: No thanks.
ELAINE: So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?
JAKE: Where did you get those?
ELAINE: At the movies.
JAKE: Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?
ELAINE: Yeah, he did.
JAKE: Then when did you get those?
ELAINE: Right after ... that ...
JAKE: So you heard that I was in a car accident, and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?
ELAINE: Well... the counter...was right there, and...
JAKE: I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.
ELAINE: No, no, it does!
JAKE: (angry) If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!
ELAINE: But...Jake...
JAKE: I would like to be alone now, please.
ELAINE: But, Jake, I didn't...
JAKE: Goodnight!
(Elaine is forced to leave.)
[Jerry's apartment]
(End of Jerry's poker night)
POKER PLAYER #1: Ah, whaddya say we call it a night?
POKER PLAYER #2: Good idea, I'm kinda tired.
POKER PLAYER #3: How'd you do?
POKER PLAYER #4: Won 50.
POKER PLAYER #2: Lost 72.
POKER PLAYER #1: Won 37.
POKER PLAYER #3: Lost 15.
JERRY: (shocked) Broke even.
["Regis and Kathy Lee"]
REGIS: Can I bring out our next guest now?
KATHY LEE: Please, please.
REGIS: Young guy, he's got a new book coming out, and it's about, and this is the best part -
KATHY LEE: I love this.
REGIS: It's a coffee table book about coffee tables! (holds the book up for the audience)
KATHY LEE: Yeah. Is that clever? I think that is so clever!
REGIS: I think so too. Did you get to meet him back stage?
KATHY LEE: I did.
REGIS: I mean, he looks like a fun guy, doesn't he?
KATHY LEE: I love his hair.
REGIS: Yeah, oh, I do too. This guy could be a little bonkos. Really. Anyway, if you will, would you please welcome: Kramer!
(Kramer comes in)
REGIS: (shaking Kramer's hand) Hello, Kramer is here.
(Kramer gets Kathy Lee's hand and pulls her in for a kiss)
KATHY LEE: I don't know, maybe it's the hair or something!
REGIS: Ah, well, yes Kramer. So, a coffee table book about coffee tables. Where did you come up with this idea?
KRAMER: Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, uh Regis... actually, this is a true story. I umm I was skiing at the time.
REGIS: You know, when I'm skiing, Kramer, I'm trying not to kill myself, you're writing books!
KRAMER: Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!
KATHY LEE: Have you always had an interest in coffee tables, because, really, I-I love coffee tables, and I-I thought I was the only one.
KRAMER: You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.
(Demonstrates with his book)
KATHY LEE: Is that fabulous?
REGIS: Look at this!
KATHY LEE: Is that fabulous?
REGIS: Fabulous!
KATHY LEE: I want one of these.
REGIS: Did I tell you this guy was bonkos?
KATHY LEE: This coffee table (book) is full of pictures of celebrities' coffee tables.
KRAMER: That's true. That's right.
REGIS: Yeah? Well, I'm not in there. Where's mine?
KRAMER: Oh, it's on file, right here. (points to his head)
REGIS: I'm tellin' ya, this guy's bonkos! He really is!
KATHY LEE: But he's adorable.
REGIS: Ya he is, he's a nice looking guy.
(Kramer takes a sip of coffee, then spits it out all over Kathy Lee's dress)
KATHY LEE: It's all over my dress.
REGIS: We'll be right back in a moment.
[Jerry's apartment]
JERRY: So it's all over?
ELAINE: Yeah, it got pretty nasty.
JERRY: And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
ELAINE: It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.
JERRY: Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
ELAINE: Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.
(Elaine points to the table)
ELAINE: What's all this?
JERRY: Played cards last night.
ELAINE: Oh yeah? How'd you do?
JERRY: Broke even.
ELAINE: You always break even.
JERRY: Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!
ELAINE: Do you have twenty bucks?
JERRY: What for?
ELAINE: Just gimme twenty bucks.
(Elaine takes the money and throws it out the window)
JERRY: (shocked) What the hell was that?
ELAINE: Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.
JERRY: You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.
ELAINE: You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together -
JERRY: Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.
(George comes in)
GEORGE: Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -
JERRY: Bad.
GEORGE: Day was -
ELAINE: Night.
GEORGE: Yes!
JERRY: So you just did the opposite of everything?
GEORGE: Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.
JERRY: So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.
GEORGE: Yes funny (laughs; hand clap) let's go.
(George rushes out, Jerry and Elaine follow him. Jerry puts his hand in his pocket)
JERRY: Elaine ... look! A twenty!
ELAINE: (not wanting to believe it) Oh my God.
[Mr. Lippman's office]
KRAMER: Hey boss.
MR. LIPPMAN: Kramer. Come in.
KRAMER: How're you doin' there, big guy? (Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian)
MR. LIPPMAN: Uh, Ya, Have a seat.
KRAMER: Al-righty (sits down) Have you got yourself a cold?
(Mr. Lippman sneezes, Kramer jumps in his chair)
KRAMER: Woah, that's quite a honk!
MR. LIPPMAN: Ya, thank you.
KRAMER: Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.
MR. LIPPMAN: The reason I asked you in here, is I-I caught your appearance on uh "Regis and Kathy Lee" the other day and -
KRAMER: Ya that was pretty good, huh?
(New sneeze, Kramer jumps again)
MR. LIPPMAN: An-Anyway, the thinking here is that it would be best i-if you uh didn't do any more of these shows.
KRAMER: Because of the coffee thing?
MR. LIPPMAN: Kramer, I'm sorry.
KRAMER: What about "Sonia Live"? Now you're not cancelling "Sonia Live"?
MR. LIPPMAN: It's out -
KRAMER: She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.
MR. LIPPMAN: Kra-Kramer, I -
(Mr. Lippman sneezes again, Kramer falls out of his chair)
[Yankee Stadium)
(George's job interview)
MR. CUSHMAN: Why don't you tell me about some of your previous work experience?
GEORGE: Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.
MR. CUSHMAN: Go on.
GEORGE: Ah, Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.
MR. CUSHMAN: Do you talk to everybody like this?
GEORGE: Of course.
MR. CUSHMAN: My niece told me you were different.
GEORGE: I am different, yeah.
MR. CUSHMAN: I gotta tell ya, you are the complete opposite of every applicant we've seen. (gets out of his chair) Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, sir. There's someone here I'd like you to meet. (George gets up and goes over) This is Mr. Costanza. He's one of the applicants.
MR. STEINBRENNER: Nice to meet you.
GEORGE: Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!
MR. STEINBRENNER: Hire this man!
(Cushman turns, shocked)
[Pendant Publishing]
SECRETARY: Tina Robbins is here to see you.
MAN: Who's that?
ELAINE: Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, I-I've been sub-letting my apartment from her.
MAN: Alright, see ya. (Meets Tina in the door) Hey.
TINA: Please.
ELAINE: Hi Tina.
TINA: Hi Elaine.
ELAINE: So, I haven't seen you in a while.
TINA: Elaine, we have a problem.
ELAINE: Well, what is it?
TINA: You're getting kicked out.
ELAINE: Kicked out?! Why?!
TINA: Well, there's been a number of complaints.
ELAINE: Yeah? Like what?
TINA: Well, like last Thanksgiving you buzzed up a jewel thief.
ELAINE: Ah, I didn't know who he was!
TINA: That's why there's a buzzer.
ELAINE: What else?
TINA: Well, apparently, the week after that, you buzzed up some Jehova's Witnesses and they couldn't get them out of the building.
ELAINE: What else have you got?
TINA: Well, let's see. (Takes out a list from her bag)
(Elaine sighs)
[Monk's]
JERRY: I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.
RACHEL: I suppose...
JERRY: Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.
RACHEL: (sighs) Jerry ...
JERRY: Yes?
RACHEL: I've been doing a lot of thinking.
JERRY: Uh huh?
RACHEL: Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.
JERRY: Oh, that's okay.
RACHEL: (confused) What?
JERRY: Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.
RACHEL: You will?
JERRY: Sure. See, things always even out for me.
RACHEL: Huh?
JERRY: It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck!
RACHEL: Yeah, you too.
JERRY: (leaving; singing) She'll be coming around the mountain...
[Jerry's apartment]
(George and Jerr)
JERRY: The New York Yankees?!
GEORGE: The New York Yankees!
JERRY: Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?
GEORGE: I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with 'em! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!
JERRY: I can't believe it.
(buzzer)
GEORGE: Ya!
JERRY: Ya?
ELAINE: (on buzzer) It's me.
JERRY: (buzzes Elaine up) Come on up.
GEORGE: And I'm moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?
JERRY: That's a great place!
GEORGE: I'm back in business, baby!
JERRY: George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.
GEORGE: Hey! (to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful)
JERRY: Hi Elaine.
ELAINE: Hi.
JERRY: How're things going?
ELAINE: How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!
JERRY: Why? Why are they doing that?
ELAINE: I don't know! They have a list of grievances.
JERRY: The jewel thief?
ELAINE: Yeah, the jewel thief.
JERRY: What else?
ELAINE: I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. (disappointed) I gotta be out by the end of the month.
GEORGE: Well, you could move in with my parents. (chuckles)
ELAINE: Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? (She squeezes George's mouth between her fingers)
GEORGE: Instinct.
ELAINE: Stick ... with the opposite. (Slaps George on the forehead)
JERRY: Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, (has his one hand up and his other hand down) he was down. Now he's up, (switches the positioning of his hands) you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?
[Pendant Publishing]
SECRETARY: Mr. Lippman, the people from Matsushimi are here.
MR. LIPPMAN: Oh ya alright... tell them I'll be right there. (tosses his handkerchief on Elaine's desk so he can tie his shoe) Oh man well, this is it, Elaine. You know, without this merger, we'd be out on the street. Boy, they sure saved us.
(Mr Lippman leaves the room, and forgets his handkerchief)
ELAINE: (noticing the forgotten handkerchief tries to stop call for Mr. Lippman with a mouth full of jujifruit) Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk.
(Mr Lippman goes to meet the Japansese businessmen who are in his office. While still in the hallway he sneezes outside his office. He no realizes he forgot his handkerchief)
CHAIRMAN: (noticing Mr. Lippman in the hallway) Ah Lippman son. (Lippman smiles and is forced to enter his office) Lippman son. (speaks some Japanese)
INTERPRETER: Mr Lippman, it is with great pride that we undertake this partnership with your company.
(The Japansese Chairman reaches out his hand to shake Mr Lippman's)
MR. LIPPMAN: I ... I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand right now. It's germs.
(This leads to a loud discussion in Japanese, and we sense a rather hostile atmosphere)
[George's parents' house]
JERRY: Is that the end of it?
GEORGE: Yeah, it's the last one.
JERRY: Alright.
ESTELLE: I can't believe you're moving out. (Grabs Kramer) Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.
KRAMER: Oh, it's true.
GEORGE: Alright, let's go.
FRANK: Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. (Slaps George's forehead)
GEORGE: I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.
ESTELLE: Jerry, did you hear this?
JERRY: He knows what he's doing.
(George pulls both his parents to him)
GEORGE: I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.
(Kramer and Jerry look at each other)
JERRY: Opposite.
[Monk's]
(Kramer, Jerry and Elaine at the usual booth; Elaine is rather underdressed)
ELAINE: I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!
JERRY: Why'd you have to eat so many?
ELAINE: Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.
JERRY: Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
KRAMER: Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose? YEA!
ELAINE: Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.
JERRY: Don't say that.
ELAINE: It's true. I'm George! I'm George!
(Enter George, dressed in a Yankees suit)
GEORGE: Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! (Sits down, says to waitress :) Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'. (Turns to the Gang) So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - (to Elaine) he's the first base man.
ELAINE: Uh huh.
GEORGE: We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , 'Donny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.' Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy.
(Jerry and Kramer pay the check)
KRAMER: Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.
JERRY: Ah ... let's call it even.
[Closing monologue]
Coffee's a drink that seems to encourage a lot of accessories around it. Coffee cake, coffee table, coffee table book, clutches of people. Say what you want about alcohol, but not only are there not a lot of optional accessories, alcohol actually helps you get rid of things. Family, home, job, driver's license. In fact, at a certain point, the only thing you have to remember to get, is more alcohol, and maybe a rag for your squeegee.
[Opening Monologue]
Baseball is so associated with sex. "He's playing the field," "Hoo, he scored," "oh, he didn't get to first base." "I struck out." "Why?" "She wanted a diamond." It's always about baseball. Always baseball. As far as baseball goes, I prefer the fat umpires...I feel if you're on the field and you're not in the game, you should be in the worst physical condition a human being could possibly be in. They should be allowed to eat during the game. We're a little too into sports in this country, I think we gotta throttle back. Know what I mean? People come home from these games, "We won! We won!" No, they won - you watched.
[Opening scene - A locker room at Yankee Stadium. George is helping Danny Tartabull with his swing.]
GEORGE: O.K., Danny, take a swing. (Tartabull swings the bat.) N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder.
TARTABULL: Really?
GEORGE: No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!
TARTABULL (wiping sweat from his brow): Alright, alright.
GEORGE: What are all sweatin' for?
TARTABULL: It's hot in this uniform.
GEORGE: Hot? (Feels Tartabull's material.) What is this?
TARTBULL: What is what?
GEORGE: This uniform, what's it made from?
TARTBULL: I don't know, cotton?
GEORGE: No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. (Tries to look at the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.) Will you stop it? (Looks at the tag.) Oh. Of course. Polyester!
TARTABULL: So?
GEORGE: I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.
TARTABULL: Well, this is what they give us.
GEORGE: You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
TARTABULL: You really think cotton's better?
GEORGE: Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.
TARTABULL: Yeah, good idea. Catch ya later. (Leaves.)
GEORGE: Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. (George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something in his back.)
[New scene - Jerry and Elaine watching the ball game in the stands.
HOT DOG VENDOR: Hot dogs here! Yankee franks!
ELAINE: Oh, you want one?
JERRY: Yeah.
ELAINE: I'll get it. (Reaches in her bag for money.)
JERRY: That's alright, I got it.
ELAINE: Jerry!
JERRY: Elaine, stop it.
ELAINE: Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two!
JERRY: I'm sorry.
ANNOUNCER ON P.A. SYSTEM: Your attention please...the New York Yankees would like to welcome Miss Connecticut, Miss Rhode Island and Miss North Dakota, all of whom will be competing in the Miss America pageant this weekend in Atlantic City. (The three contestants make their way to their seats, right across the aisle from Jerry and Elaine.)
JERRY (to Elaine): Now, there's a career path you may have overlooked.
ELAINE: Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.
JERRY: Oh, she worked at Doubleday...?
ELAINE: Yeah, she was an editor.
JERRY: Right, just like you.
ELAINE: Yeah. Can you hold my seat? (Elaine gets up.)
CROWD: Hey! Down in front! (Elaine clambers over Jerry and exits.)
JERRY (offers a hot dog to Miss Rhode Island): Hot dog?
MISS RHODE ISLAND: No, thanks. I'm watching my weight.
JERRY: Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh...
MISS RHODE ISLAND: Rhode Island.
JERRY: I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. (Miss Rhode Island laughs.)
[New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.]
GEORGE: Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?
JERRY: Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.
GEORGE: You're incredible.
JERRY: And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.
GEORGE: What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!
JERRY: The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.
GEORGE: Chaperone? What, are you kidding?
JERRY: No, it's part of the contest rules.
GEORGE: What does the chaperone do?
JERRY: I don't know, she just sits there.
GEORGE: Can she talk?
JERRY: I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. (Picks up the phone and dials.)
GEORGE: You're calling her?
JERRY: Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?
GEORGE: Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?
JERRY: Of course, they're polyester.
GEORGE: Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.
JERRY: Why do they wear polyester?
GEORGE: I don't know. That's all gonna change.
JERRY: You're going to do something about it?
GEORGE: Why shouldn't I?
JERRY (doubtfully): No reason...
[New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.]
LANDIS: Of course, Jackie O. was a great lady. Those are going to be some tough shoes to fill. Everyone loved her. She had such...grace.
ELAINE (gushing): Yes! Grace!
LANDIS: Not many people have grace.
ELAINE: Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -
LANDIS: You can't have "a little grace." You either have grace, or you...don't.
ELAINE: O.K., fine, I have...no grace.
LANDIS: And you can't acquire grace.
ELAINE: Well, I have no intention of "getting" grace.
LANDIS: Grace isn't something you can pick up at the market.
ELAINE (fed up): Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't want grace...I don't even say grace, O.K.?
LANDIS: Thank you for coming in.
ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, right.
LANDIS: We'll make our choice in a few days, and we'll let you know.
ELAINE (stands up): I have no chance, do I?
LANDIS: No. (They shake hands.)
LANDIS'S INTERCOM: Justin Pitt to see you.
ELAINE: Justin Pitt?
LANDIS: He was a very close friend of Mrs. Onassis's.
ELAINE: "Mrs. Onassis's"? That's hard to pronounce.
LANDIS: Excuse me?
ELAINE: Nothing. (Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.)
PITT: Mrs. Landis, there's something wrong with this copying machine, it's all coming out slanted. Now, I don't know if this is your department or not.
LANDIS: Justin Pitt, this is Elaine Benes. (Elaine turns around. With sunglasses and a scarf on her head, she bears a close resemblance to Jackie O.)
PITT (clearly affected by Elaine's appearance): Charmed.
ELAINE: I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...
[Cut back to Jerry's apartment; Jerry's on the phone with Miss Rhode Island.]
JERRY: Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that "Miss Congeniality" on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going? (Kramer enters.) Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey, what are you doing tonight?
KRAMER: Nothin.'
JERRY: I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?
KRAMER: What state?
JERRY: Rhode Island.
KRAMER: They're never in contention.
GEORGE: How do you know?
KRAMER: Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.
JERRY: Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.
KRAMER: Giddy-up!
JERRY (to Karen): I think I got someone!
[New scene - Elaine and Mr. Pitt having lunch at the coffee shop.]
PITT (looking at Elaine and smiling): The resemblance is uncanny. (Elaine, sipping soda through a straw, looks up with a sour expression on her face.) Even the brown eyes.
ELAINE: Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.
PITT: No, there's something else. An indefinable quality.
ELAINE: Grace?
PITT: Grace, yes.
ELAINE: You think Ihave grace?
PITT: Some grace, yes.
ELAINE: Just some?
PITT: Well, you don't want too much grace or you won't be able to stand.
ELAINE (laughing): Oh, Mr. Pitt.
PITT: Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant, but I would need you to start right away.
[New scene - George approaches Buck Showalter at Yankee Stadium.]
GEORGE: Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?
SHOWALTER: Sure, George.
GEORGE: How's everything going? Everything O.K.?
SHOWALTER: Well, all of a sudden there's a problem with Tartabull's swing...
GEORGE: Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.
SHOWALTER: How so?
GEORGE: Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.
SHOWALTER: Cotton, huh?
GEORGE: Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.
SHOWALTER: You may have something there, George.
GEORGE: Oh - I've got something.
SHOWALTER (considering): Hmm. Cotton uniforms.
[New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY: Congratulations!
ELAINE: Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.
JERRY: Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
ELAINE: I attend to his personal affairs.
JERRY: Like what?
ELAINE: Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks.
JERRY: Really! Socks!
ELAINE: Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.
JERRY: Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! (Kramer enters.)
KRAMER (shows Jerry his outfit): So, what do you think? Does this work?
JERRY: Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just "recede into the night," if you know what I mean.
KRAMER: No way!
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy.
JERRY: I'm not going to "defile" her!
KRAMER: That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.
JERRY: But -
KRAMER (holds up his hand): AAAH! No buts! Those are my rules.
JERRY: But wait a minute...
KRAMER: Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! (Jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an inch.)
[New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.]
KRAMER: If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?
KAREN: As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed the whole world!
JERRY: That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen -
KRAMER (to Karen): What advice would you give young people?
JERRY: Alright, Kramer!
KRAMER: This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts.
KAREN: You really know a lot about this, don't you?
KRAMER: Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.
KAREN: Well, what could she have done?
KRAMER: Tape her breasts together. (Jerry is shocked.)
KAREN: What else?
KRAMER: Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.
JERRY: Hey, come on!
KAREN: No, no...it's O.K. (To Kramer) Go on.
KRAMER: Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher.
KAREN: Really.
KRAMER: Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.
JERRY: I'll be right back. (Leaves the table.)
KRAMER: So, what's your talent?
KAREN: Magic.
KRAMER: Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.
KAREN: Six.
KRAMER: No, five. But you were close.
[Cut to Jerry on his way past the restaurant bar. He notices the ballgame on TV.]
ANNOUNCER #1: And the Yankees take the field!
ANNOUNCER #2: Is it my imagination, or do the Yankees look a little different tonight? I can't put my finger on it...
ANNOUNCER #1: Well, from what I understand, they've switched to cotton uniforms.
ANNOUNCER #2: They seem blousier, softer...
ANNOUNCER #1: Well, it is a natural fibre...
(Jerry shakes his head and continues on his way.)
[New scene - Jerry, Karen and Kramer heading home in the limo. Kramer is still going on about the pageant.]
KRAMER: How's your evening?
KAREN: Well, I'm wearing this red dress -
KRAMER: Stop right there.
KAREN: No good?
KRAMER: Disaster.
KAREN: Why?
KRAMER: Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.
KAREN: That makes sense. (The limo stops at Karen's hotel.)
JERRY: Well, here we are...
KAREN: Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the pageant?
KRAMER: Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all.
KAREN: I am in your hands. (They shake hands.) Well! Oh, good night, Jerry. (They're about to kiss, but Kramer stops them by clearing his throat.) Kenneth will take you home. (She gets out, leaving Jerry staring at Kramer with an angry expression on his face.)
(Scene ends with an exterior shot of the limo going down the street. We hear Kramer singing the Miss America theme song, and Jerry telling him to "shut the f*ck up.")
[New scene - Jerry's apartment the next day. Jerry's packing to go to Atlantic City. Kramer enters.]
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell.
KRAMER: Oh, come on.
JERRY: And that waist cincher, that was the topper!
KRAMER: Oh, you're poo-pooing!
JERRY: Yes, I poo-poo.
KRAMER: Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!
JERRY: I don't want to stop her!
KRAMER: You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something! (Turns to leave.)
JERRY: Yeah, so do you. (George enters with a newspaper.)
GEORGE: Well, did you see it?
JERRY: See what?
GEORGE: The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! (reads from the paper) "Wade Boggs: 'What a fabric! Finally we can breathe.' Luis Palonia: 'Cotton is king.' Paul O'Neill: 'I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.' "
JERRY: Boy, they really do sound comfortable.
GEORGE (noticing Jerry's suitcase): Hey, where ya goin'?
JERRY: I'm working in Atlantic City.
GEORGE: Really!
JERRY: Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?
GEORGE: Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.
JERRY: You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. (Picks up the phone.) She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...
[New scene - Elaine at Mr. Pitt's. He's trying on the socks she's brought him.]
ELAINE: So, what do you think?
PITT (pulling up the socks): No.
ELAINE: You don't like them?
PITT: No, I don't like them.
ELAINE: What's wrong?
PITT: They're too tight.
ELAINE: Too tight?
PITT: There's no elastic, you need to pull too much (pulls them up more).
ELAINE (examining the socks): I think they look good!
PITT: They're cutting off the circulation.
ELAINE: Alright, well, I'll just take them back. (The phone rings.)
PITT: Hello?
JERRY: Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there?
PITT (hands the phone to Elaine): It's for you.
ELAINE: Sorry. Hello?
JERRY: Hey Elaine, it's me.
ELAINE: Jerry?
JERRY: We're going to Atlantic City.
ELAINE: Really? When?
JERRY: Today, right now! Are you in?
ELAINE: One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?
PITT: Tomorrow?
ELAINE: Yes.
PITT: But I was hoping for my new socks today!
ELAINE: Well, it's just one more day.
PITT: I'm sorry. I must have them today.
ELAINE (to Jerry): I can't go.
JERRY: Why not?
ELAINE: Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
PITT: Elaine!
ELAINE: I gotta go. (Hangs up.)
[New scene - Kramer and Karen at the hotel in Atlantic City. Karen is rehearsing her stage-walking with Kramer. She does it once, but Kramer isn't satisfied.]
KRAMER: No. Alright, watch me now. (Karen sits on the bed. Kramer walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile on his face.) Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture.
KAREN: Yes, I see. O.K.
KRAMER: Let's try a few more questions, alright? (Karen stands up.) If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?
KAREN: Kramer, are these questions really that important...?
KRAMER: Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!
[New scene - Jerry in he and George's hotel room on the floor above Karen's. George enters.]
GEORGE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
GEORGE: How was the show?
JERRY: Good. How was the roulette?
GEORGE: I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.
JERRY: Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!
[Cut back to Elaine at Mr. Pitt's. There are pairs of socks everywhere. Pitt has on the latest pair.]
PITT: It's good, but...
ELAINE: But what??
PITT: Ultimately I don't think they'll stay up.
ELAINE (pulling up Pitt's socks): No, no! They'll stay up!
PITT: For a while, yes, but not in the long run.
ELAINE: But that's why I got you the tighter ones! (Holds them up.)
PITT: Oh, forget about those! (Takes the socks from Elaine and throws them on the floor.) Why do you keep mentioning those?
ELAINE: What do you want!?
PITT: I want a decent sock that's comfortable, that will stay on my foot!!
(Elaine curls up into a fetal position.)
[Cut back to Atlantic City, the middle of the night. Jerry and George are trying to sleep, but a flock of birds outside is keeping them awake.]
JERRY: What the hell is that?
GEORGE: I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!
JERRY (getting out of bed): Well, I can't sleep with that noise.
GEORGE: Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?
JERRY: Wait a second. (Grabs the icebucket off the counter.) This'll scare 'em off. (Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. Jerry gets back into bed.) Well, good night, Ollie.
GEORGE: Good night, Stan.
[New scene - Karen's hotel room the next morning. Upset, she lets Kramer in.]
KRAMER: What is it?
KAREN: My doves! They're dead! I trained those birds for eight years! How am I supposed to do my magic act now?
KRAMER: How did this happen?
KAREN: They like it outside, so I kept them in a cage on the terrace...then I found them dead in a pool of water!
KRAMER (goes out on the terrace to look, and slips in the water): Well, how did this happen?
KAREN: It must have been an accident.
KRAMER: Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.
[New scene - Jerry watching TV in his room. There's a knock at the door; Jerry lets Kramer in.]
KRAMER: Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!
JERRY: What? Why? What happened?
KRAMER: Her birds are dead.
JERRY: Birds?
KRAMER: Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! (Kramer turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.)
JERRY: What are you looking at? (Kramer goes out onto the terrace and looks down.) Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold.
KRAMER (comes back inside with his finger pointed at Jerry): You killed them, didn't you?
JERRY: No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!
KRAMER: Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!
JERRY: Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! (Kramer exits.)
GEORGE (comes out of the bathroom brushing his teeth): What was that all about?
JERRY: Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.
GEORGE: Oh. (Goes back into the bathroom.)
[New scene - The night of the Miss America pageant. Kramer and Karen are backstage. Regis Philbin is about to introduce Miss Rhode Island in the talent competition.]
KAREN: O.K., this is it!
KRAMER: How ya feelin'?
KAREN: I'm a little nervous!
KRAMER: There's nothing to be nervous about.
KAREN: But I've never sung before in my life!
PHILBIN: And now, let's welcome Karen Ann Hanson, Miss Rhode Island!
(Karen walks out on stage and starts singing, badly. Cut to Jerry and George watching the pageant on TV at the hotel.)
JERRY: I heard those doves were really incredible.
GEORGE: That's a shame. (Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.)
JERRY: It's like watching an animal get tortured.
GEORGE: Hey, hey! Yankee game! (Changes the channel.)
JERRY: Oh, great! Alright. (We hear the announcers calling the game.)
ANNOUNCER #1: And the Yankees take the field!
ANNOUNCER #2: What is with the Yankees? They look like they're having trouble running, they can't move!
ANNOUNCER #1: It's their uniforms, they're too tight, they've shrunk! They're running like penguins! Forget this game!
ANNOUNCER #2: Oh my God, Mattingly just split his pants!
JERRY: That's a shame.
(Cut back to Karen on-stage at the pageant, still singing horribly. Kramer is shown in the wings, still trying to coach her.)
KRAMER: Poise. Poise!
[Closing Monologue]
The Miss America pageant seems like a really tough contest. You know, you gotta come out there in the bathing suit, in the dress shoes...they got that "sanitized for your protection" toilet seat-thing hangin' off them, you know...plus, they gotta wear all the other outfits. I don't know why, the bathing suit is the contest. You win the bathing suit, you win. What is the formal wear? Everybody looks good in formal wear; it's dark, it covers everything - that's why we have weddings in it. I mean, if we had weddings in bathing suits, a lot of ceremonies wouldn't be able to get past "If anyone sees any reason why these two people should not be joined together..." About eighty hands go up...
[Opening Monologue]
Its fascinating. When you go into a stationery store that they're manufacturing millions of pens; constantly we're all buying them. I must have bought six thousand Bics in my life. I've used up maybe two of them. Where are the rest of them? When you move the refrigerator there's a couple back there but it doesn't account for it. Where are all the pens? That's why it's so embarrassing if you don't have one. You got a pen? Can I borrow a pen? We always have to whisper because it's so humiliating. I don't have a pen. They're making millions of them every week!   I know; where are they?
[Stationery store]
STATIONER: May I help you?
ELAINE: Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.
STATIONER: Oh, I know the Rollamech 1000.
ELAINE: No, I'm sure you do.
STATIONER: They're pretty expensive.
ELAINE: Well, it's for my boss.
STATIONER: What do you do?
Ex: Whatever.
STATIONER: Well, we don't have any in stock right now but I would be happy to order it for you. Just give me your phone number and when it comes in I'll give you a call. You're name is?
ELAINE: Elaine.
STATIONER: Elaine, . . . and your last name?
ELAINE: It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha
STATIONER: And your number?
ELAINE: Uh, aw, KL5-239O.
STATIONER: Okay. Thanks a lot. You'll be hearing from me.
ELAINE: Okay, (to Jerry)  Move  along. . .
JERRY: Why did you give him MY number?
[On the street]
ELAINE: I think he's got ideas.
JERRY: I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
JERRY: Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?
(On the street)
ELAINE: Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?
JERRY: Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here.
GEORGE: Hey, hey.
ELAINE: Hey hey
JULIE: Hi Jerry.
JERRY: Hi Julie.
GEORGE: Elaine, Julie.
ELAINE: Hi.
JULIE: Hi.
JULIE: Oh, hi.  Elaine's my middle name.
ELAINE: Oh, mine's "Ike".
GEORGE: Hey, wanna get some lunch?
JERRY: Just had a big bowl of Kix.
GEORGE: Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?
ELAINE: Ah, no.
JULIE: Please come, Elaine.
ELAINE: No, no. How about if you bring me back something?
GEORGE: Sure, all right, what do you want?
ELAINE: Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?
GEORGE: What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.
ELAINE: They have big salads.
GEORGE: I've never seen a big salad.
ELAINE: They have a big salad.
GEORGE: Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?
ELAINE: It's okay, you don't…
GEORGE: No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?
JERRY: Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs.
GEORGE: (???), we'll see you in a little while.
[Jerry's]
ELAINE: Maybe I should just get married.
JERRY: Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?
ELAINE: I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.
JERRY: People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
ELAINE: You can say that again.
JERRY: It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.
ELAINE: Good for you.
JERRY: I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
ELAINE: Right on baby. (???)
(noise from hall)
JERRY: What was that?
(Kramer enters with his golf clubs)
KRAMER: That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.
ELAINE: Who Gendason?
KRAMER: Steve Gendason.
ELAINE: Why is that name familiar?
Hx: He used to be a baseball player.
ELAINE: Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?
KRAMER: Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.
ELAINE: So what?
KRAMER: Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.
JERRY: Certainly are.
KRAMER: Ya, so I penalized him a stroke.
Jx; Ah, so what happened?
KRAMER: He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .
JERRY: All right. You're in MY face.
ELAINE: I still don't see what the big deal is.
KRAMER: A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.
[Monks]
JULIE: I like Anna Quindlen's column and Safire. Don't you like Safire?
GEORGE: Oh, Safire. Uh ha
JULIE: Although at times can be rather pedantic.
GEORGE: He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.
JULIE: And Bob Herbert's great. He's the Daily News.
GEORGE: Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No "r" which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. "Hebert" it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. (check arrives) All right. I
got it.
JULIE: No, no. I'd like to take you out.
GEORGE: No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.
JULIE: Okay, thanks, George.
Wx: Here's your big salad to go.
JULIE: Oh, thank you.
[Jerry's]
JERRY: (on phone) Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil.
ELAINE: I told ya'. He has ideas.
JERRY: He doesn't even care if a man answers.
ELAINE: Or you.
(George and Julie enter)
GEORGE: Hey, hey.
ELAINE: Hey.
JULIE: Sorry e're late.
ELAINE: No problem.
JULIE: Here's your big salad.
ELAINE: Thank you, Julie.
JULIE: Oh, you're very welcome. So, I guess I better get going. Gotta meet mother a t the Guggenheim. Sure you don't want to go?
GEORGE: No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.
JULIE: Sure, George.
GEORGE: Ya, you go.
JULIE: Okay, I'll see you later. Goodbye.
JERRY: Bye bye
(Julie exits)
GEORGE: Did you see what just happened?
JERRY: Well, that all depends. . .
GEORGE: Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?
JERRY: Yeah, so?
GEORGE: Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.
JERRY: Is that a fact?
GEORGE: Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.
JERRY: No it isn't.
GEORGE: I mean I'm the one who bought it.
JERRY: Yes you did.
GEORGE: You think she should have said something?
JERRY: She could have.
GEORGE: Oh, I know.
JERRY: Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.
GEORGE: You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.
JERRY: Obviously.
(Kramer rushes in)
KRAMER: Turn on the TV.
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: I'm puttin it on…
TV: . . . the district attorney's office and the police department have not answered any questions as yet. To repeat in case you're just joining us. Former baseball start Steve Genderson, has been taken to Police headquarters for questioning the murder of Bobby Pinkus the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue. According to Pinkus' wife, Gendeson had been involved in a dispute with the cleaner about a stain on a pair of gray Sans-A-Belt slacks. We also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper at Vancourtland's Golf Course saw an irate Gendeson leaving the clubhouse in a huff. Whether there is a possible connection between the two is something we'll just have to wait.
KRAMER: Jerry . . .
JERRY: Well, it has nothing to do with you.
KRAMER: Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.
JERRY: Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.
[In a cab]
ELAINE: I like Julie. She's very personable.
GEORGE: Yeah, she's very lovely.
ELAINE: That's great George.
GEORGE: So did you enjoy your lunch?
ELAINE: Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?
GEORGE: oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .
ELAINE: Even though what?
GEORGE: . . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the difference?
ELAINE: What? What are you trying to say, George?
GEORGE: It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.
ELAINE: You want the money for the big salad, George?
GEORGE: No, no,
ELAINE: What is the problem?
GEORGE: There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.
[Jerry's]
JERRY: And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
MARGARET: Well, they haven't even arrested him yet. Come on, let's go out.
JERRY: Ah, no , I don't think so.
MARGARET: Why not?
JERRY: We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
MARGARET: Who is staring?
JERRY: Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.
(Phone rings)
JERRY: Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.
(Newman enters)
JERRY: Hello Newman.
MARGARET: Hello Jerry, I was wondering if you knew where Kramer was.
JERRY: No, no I don't. Why?
MARGARET: You know, Genderson. This is something big.
JERRY: I suppose.
MARGARET: What did Kramer say?
JERRY: I don't know. Nothing.?
MARGARET: Come on Jerry. You know something TELL ME! TELL ME!, Oh, chocolates . . . Margaret?
MARGARET: Hello.
JERRY: You two know each other?
NEWMAN: You might say that.
MARGARET: We used to go out.
NEWMAN: Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe
JERRY: . . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?
MARGARET: Just a few times.
JERRY: Why?
MARGARET: I liked him.
JERRY: You liked, Newman?
MARGARET: Look I'm a little uncomfortable talking about this okay?
JERRY: No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.
MARGARET: He ended it.
JERRY: . . . HE ended it?
MARGARET: YES!! Yes! It was a couple of years ago. Why does it matter?
JERRY: No, no of course not.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Jerry, Jerry they found a tee.
JERRY: What tee?
KRAMER: A golf tee. In the dry cleaner.
[Monk's]
JERRY: Newman! She went out with Newman!
ELAINE: It must be a mistake.
JERRY: No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?
ELAINE: Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.
JERRY: No, there's less.
ELAINE: It's possible.
JERRY: No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.
ELAINE: He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.
JERRY: Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.
Wx: Would you like some more coffee?
JERRY: No,, but thank you.
JERRY: Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.
ELAINE: Ugh! You are kidding me.
JERRY: No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.
ELAINE: I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street.
JERRY: Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.
ELAINE: To please Mr. Pitt.
JERRY: Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.
ELAINE: Uh, great!
JERRY: Hi Julie.
JERRY: Hi.
ELAINE: Hi Julie.
JERRY: Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.
ELAINE: Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.
JERRY: How do you know THAT?
[Newman's apartment]
(knock knock)
NEWMAN: Who is it.
JERRY: It's Jerry.
NEWMAN: You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?
JERRY: Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!
NEWMAN: Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?
JERRY: Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?
NEWMAN: There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
JERRY: No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?
NEWMAN: Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.
JERRY: Noit your type?
NEWMAN: Not really.
JERRY: Well, how come?
NEWMAN: Ah, she just didn't do it for me.
JERRY: What, what is wrong with her?
NEWMAN: Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.
JERRY: You don't think she's attractive?
NEWMAN: No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.
JERRY: Okay, Newman, thanks a lot.
NEWMAN: Care for some lemonade?
JERRY: No, thank you.
NEWMAN: Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha
[Jerry's apartment]
KRAMER: Listen to this, "If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. " That's a rule, Jerry.
JERRY: But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?
KRAMER: Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.
JERRY: What are you so worried about this for?
KRAMER: You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?
JERRY: He did?
KRAMER: Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus.
JERRY: So it had nothing to do with you.
KRAMER: Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.
JERRY: No, I don't think so.
KRAMER: Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus.
JERRY: Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that.
JERRY: Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?
KRAMER: Oh, I love curls.
JERRY: Yeah,, me too.
KRAMER: All right, I'll see you later.
JERRY: Where you going?
KRAMER: Genderson's.
JERRY: You're going to see Genderson?
KRAMER: It's weighing on my conscience.
[Monk's]
GEORGE: You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?
JULIE: Ha. So, George, I was talking to Elaine before.
GEORGE: A ha! We're just friends.
JULIE: Yes, well anyway, she said something that was kind of intriguing.
GEORGE: Oh, share.
JULIE: Well, when I came over to the table she mentioned something about how she better hurry up and leave or you'd make her buy lunch to make up for the one you bought yesterday.
GEORGE: Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.
JULIE: Well, my question is, How could Elaine be under the impression that you bought the big salad, when I was the one who handed it to her?
GEORGE: Well, she probably just assumed.
JULIE: Um, did she?
GEORGE: . . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?
JULIE: That's what I'm suggesting.
GEORGE: . . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?
JULIE: George, all I did was hand someone a bag.
(Julie leaves)
[Stationery store]
ELAINE: It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.
STATIONER: Well,, why did you tell me to order it if you knew you were going to get one someplace else?
ELAINE: No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.
STATIONER: I went all the way down to the warehouse. It took me three hours. I had a big fight with the foreman.
ELAINE: Really? A fight with the foreman?
STATIONER: Yes.
ELAINE: Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.
STATIONER: Yeah? Well, then how about going out with me tonight?
ELAINE: Okay.
(In Margaret's car)
MARGARET: I mean they found a tee and he played golf that day. Nobody walks into a dry cleaner's with a tee. The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming.
JERRY: You had how many dates with him? Three?
MARGARET: Around three. I don't know.
JERRY: And . .
MARGARET: I told you. He stopped calling me. I moved on. I'm not hung up on him. What are you looking at?
JERRY: What? I'm not looking. Nothing.
JERRY: Why are you looking at my face?
JERRY: Where am I going to look?
MARGARET: Kiss me.
JERRY: . . . I can't.
(Throws Jerry out onto sidewalk and drives off)
JERRY: Newman!
[Jerry's apartment]
JERRY: All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.
ELAINE: Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.
JERRY: You're going out with the stationery store guy?
ELAINE: I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.
(George enters, upset)
ELAINE: Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.
ELAINE: Uh, uh.
GEORGE: You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD.
(phone rings)
JERRY: Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.
TV: As you can see white Bronco. The police have cleared the highway traffic in front of him but they are keeping their distance and don't want the situation to escalate. And we have gotten an identification on the driver of the vehicle. His name is; Kramer, one of Genderson's golfing buddies.
POLICE: 9-1-1 What are you reporting
KRAMER: Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off.
POLICE: Okay, sir, and what's your name?
KRAMER: My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!
Genderson: I told you not to take the turnpike.
KRAMER: I thought we would blend in.
Genderson: If we took the palisades this never have happened.
KRAMER: we would have had all that bridge traffic.
Genderson: Ah, just drive.
[Closing Monologue]
(Jail?) doesn't really seem like that great of revenge. Wouldn't years of subtle psychological mind games be a lot more satisfying? Constantly calling him, hanging up when he answers the phone. Sending pizzas and taxis to their house all night long. After a while he would go, "I wish that guy would kill me already, I can't take it anymore." And how come when the police catch some really bad criminal or something they put him in the handcuffs, they hit him with the baton, they put the choke hold on him, then they're always careful they don't want him to hurt his head when they're putting him in the back of the patrol car. "Watch your head, watch your head. Don't hit that metal edge there. . . . That REALLY hurts"
[Opening monologue.]
There's something very insincere about these greeting cards we send back and forth to each other all the time. They're like these little one-dollar folded paper emotional prostitutes, isn't it? "I don't know what my feelings are, so I'll just pay some total stranger a buck to make up this little Hallmark hooker to do the job for me. So I can go, 'Yeah, I didn't write this, but whatever they wrote, I think the same thing.'" Wouldn't it be better if we just had one card that covered every occasion for everybody in one shot? Just "Happy birthday, merry Christmas, happy anniversary, congratulations, it's a Boy and our deepest sympathies. Signed, the whole office"
[Elaine and Jerry and in Jerry's apartment.]
ELAINE: She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?
JERRY: Your friend, Noreen.
ELAINE: Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?
JERRY: If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.
ELAINE: I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.
JERRY: If you don't believe me, ask her.
ELAINE: I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?
JERRY: Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.
ELAINE: Yeah.
(Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?
JERRY: Check the pile.
KRAMER: (leafing through Jerry's mail) Oh, who sent you a card?
JERRY: I don't know.
KRAMER: Open it, it's from Hallmark.
JERRY: Oh.
KRAMER (To Elaine) Hello, my love.
ELAINE: Hello, darling.
JERRY: Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.
KRAMER: Let me see.
ELAINE: Who's Kristin?
JERRY: She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.
KRAMER: Did you ask her about me?
JERRY: Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone.
KRAMER: Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?
JERRY: No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station.
KRAMER: Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?
JERRY: Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.
(Kramer leaves, satisfied.)
ELAINE: (dialing the phone) You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.
JERRY: Oh, go ahead.
ELAINE: You sure you don't mind?
JERRY: Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.
(Elaine finishes dialing, the phone rings and a high pitched voice answers.)
HIGH PITCHED VOICE: Hello?
ELAINE: Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.
HIGH PITCHED VOICE: Jerry?
ELAINE: Jerry Seinfeld.
HIGH PITCHED VOICE: Oh, I like Jerry a lot.
ELAINE: You mean like like?
HIGH PITCHED VOICE: What are you talking about?
ELAINE: Noreen, were you hitting on him?
(Cut to the other end of the conversation, there's a bald man on the telephone.)
HIGH PITCHED VOICE: Noreen's not here, this is Dan.
ELAINE: Ooh.
DAN: You say that Noreen was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?
ELAINE (hanging up) Uh, I'll call you back later.
ELAINE: Uh oh.
JERRY: So was I right? She likes me, right?
[Elaine is sharpening pencils for Mr. Pitt. The phone is ringing.]
MR. PITT (answering) Hello? (to Elaine) It's for you. Must you keep giving my number out?
ELAINE: Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Pitt. Hello?
HIGH PITCHED VOICE: Elaine? What is going on? Why did you tell Dan I was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?
ELAINE: Is this Noreen?
HIGH PITCHED VOICE: (Noreen) What would ever possess you to make up a story like that.
ELAINE: Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--
DAN (taking the phone from Noreen) I think I deserve an explanation.
ELAINE: Noreen, are you crying?
DAN: No, this is Dan!
ELAINE: Oh, hi Dan.
MR. PITT: Elaine? Work?
ELAINE: Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.
MR. PITT: Who was crying?
ELAINE: No one. I'm sorry Mr. Pitt, that won't happen again.
MR. PITT: (unwrapping a candy bar, placing it on a plate and cutting it with knife and fork) I'm sure it won't, but someone was crying and I want to know who it was.
ELAINE: Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was-- (noticing Mr. Pitt eating the candy bar with knife and fork and becoming distracted) You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--
[Jerry and Kristin, the PBS rep, are in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is reading from a sheet of paper.]
JERRY: I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now.
KRISTIN: Jerry, I am so grateful that you're doing this.
JERRY: Oh, I know you are.
KRISTIN: You got the card I sent?
JERRY: I did.
KRISTIN: So where is it?
JERRY: What?
KRISTIN: The card. Is this it in the trash?
JERRY: No?
KRISTIN: This is my card, you threw it away.
JERRY: Well--
KRISTIN: I put a lot of thought into this card.
JERRY: You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem.
KRISTIN: Fine. I gotta get back to the office.
JERRY: Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?
KRISTIN: You have no sentimentality.
JERRY: I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy.
KRISTIN: Oh, so you save her cards but not mine! Oh great!
JERRY: (as Kristin is storming out) Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?
(Kramer enters as Kristin leaves.)
KRAMER: New cards, huh?
JERRY: No, they're old cards from my grandmother.
KRAMER: Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person's spirits.
JERRY: Yeah.
KRAMER: (opening a card) Oh, a check.
JERRY: Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them.
KRAMER: There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?
JERRY: I don't know, it's ten dollars.
KRAMER: But you got a whole pile here. 1987?
JERRY: Oh so what.
KRAMER: Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face.
JERRY: Oh, get out of here.
KRAMER: Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.
JERRY: Alright, alright, I'll cash the checks.
KRAMER: Yeah.
[Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.]
JERRY: It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?
GEORGE: The rule is a minimum of two days.
JERRY: You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?
GEORGE: I'm making it up.
JERRY: I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel.
GEORGE: Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.
JERRY: Absolutely.
GEORGE: If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.
JERRY: So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.
GEORGE: Let's have it.
JERRY: Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me...
GEORGE: You want me to ask one of the Yankees.
JERRY: Could you?
GEORGE: Alright. I'll run it by a few people.
JERRY: Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.
ELAINE: (entering and sitting down) I should never have made that phone call.
JERRY: Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?
ELAINE: Yes, she's very upset.
JERRY: So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?
ELAINE: I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--
GEORGE: Who was flirting with you?
JERRY: Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?
GEORGE: She wasn't flirting with you.
JERRY: Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on.
ELAINE: Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.
(Elaine and George laugh derisively.)
JERRY: Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?
ELAINE: So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.
GEORGE: Really?
ELAINE: Yeah.
JERRY: Why does he do that?
GEORGE: He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.
JERRY: Oh, you know.
GEORGE: What, you think I eat all my meals with you? (To waitress) Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?
WAITRESS: That's the extra toast. Get it?
GEORGE: Got it. (the waitress walks away) Did you just see what happened here?
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.
JERRY: That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.
[George is in a meeting at work.]
GEORGE: So, what do you think?
MR. MORGAN: A PBS fundraiser? I'm not gonna waste any of the players' time with that, besides the team already does so much promotion for channel eleven.
GEORGE: Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven.
(George begins eating a candy bar with knife and fork.)
MR. MORGAN: Uh, what the hell are you doing?
GEORGE: I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?
MR. MORGAN: You know, maybe George has something here about PBS.
[Jerry and Kramer are at an ATM.]
JERRY: Okay, sixty bucks from Nana.
KRAMER: Huh? Yeah.
[Nana is home knitting, the phone rings.]
NANA: Hello?
VOICE: Hello, this is Chemical Bank. Just wanted you to know that your checking account is overdrawn.
NANA: Chemical Bank? I haven't used that account in months.
VOICE: Well, someone's been cashing the checks and you're overdrawn.
NANA: Oh dear. I'll be down there first thing in the morning.
VOICE: (unheard by Nana as she hangs up the phone) Wait, we can do this over the phone.
(Fade to the next morning, the alarm clock goes off, it's 5:30, Nana turns off the alarm, fully dressed, gathers her coat and purse, sighs, and heads for the door.)
[George, Jerry and Kramer are at the coffee shop.]
JERRY: You got Danny Tartabull?!
GEORGE: You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.
JERRY: Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.
GEORGE: Hey, the Bull owes me one, I helped him with his swing.
KRAMER: So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight.
GEORGE: Absolutely. Pending approval of the script.
JERRY: Excuse me?
GEORGE: Jerry, I'm Yankee management.
KRAMER: Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.
JERRY: You're just answering phones!
KRAMER: It would put me at ease.
GEORGE: Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses.
JERRY: Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men
WAITRESS: Oh, you're getting it (pointing to menu with index finger), it comes with your breakfast special.
JERRY: Right you are.
GEORGE: I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.
WAITRESS: (scratching cheek with middle finger) I'll check.
GEORGE: (after waitress walks away) I don't believe it, she did it again!
JERRY: Oh, she had an itch.
GEORGE: She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me.
KRAMER (laughing) Yeah, she knew what she was doing.
JERRY: By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks.
[Nana is standing on a deserted street in front of an abandoned building, checking for an address. A street tough approaches from behind.]
STREET TOUGH: Looking for something, lady?
NANA: Isn't the Chemical Bank on this block?
STREET TOUGH: The bank? It burned. It's gone!
NANA: Oh dear.
STREET TOUGH Now what you wanna do is go down to forty-ninth street, that's the main customer service branch. Ask for Mr. Fleming. He'll help you.
[Jerry is in his apartment, the phone rings.]
JERRY: (answering) Hello?
UNCLE LEO: Jerry? Hello.
JERRY: Uncle Leo!
UNCLE LEO: Listen, I don't want to alarm you, but your nana is missing.
(Kramer enters.)
JERRY: Nana's missing?
UNCLE LEO: I came to pick her up for a doctor's appointment, she wasn't here. I called the doctor, nobody knows where she is. She hasn't left the apartment in twenty-five years!
JERRY: I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.
KRAMER: Yeah, that's right. You did.
UNCLE LEO: What kind of checks?
JERRY: I think Chemical Bank.
KRAMER: Oh, they were Chemical.
UNCLE LEO: Chemical?! She hasn't used that account since her branch closed. What are you doing cashing her checks anyway?
JERRY: Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. (To Kramer) I never should have cashed those checks!
KRAMER: Hey, I didn't twist your arm.
UNCLE LEO: Your grandmother's on a very fixed income. What, are you broke?
JERRY: Just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces Kramer) Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!
KRAMER: Well, don't look at me.
JERRY: It's your fault!
KRAMER: My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.
[Mr. Morgan is sitting at an outdoor cafe, eating a candy bar with a knife and fork. Noreen walks by and takes notice. Cut to Noreen and Elaine seated at the counter at Monk's.]
NOREEN: So anyway, it's caused a lot of problems. Dan thinks I'm interested in Jerry, he won't let up.
ELAINE: I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.
NOREEN: No, why?
ELAINE: Well, you know, because he's a high talker.
NOREEN: He does raise his voice occasionally, but that's normal.
ELAINE: No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.
NOREEN: Really?
ELAINE: You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?
NOREEN: I never noticed that.
ELAINE: Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?
NOREEN: Great. I'm going out with a man who sounds like a woman.
ELAINE: Well, he looks like a man.
NOREEN: Yeah.
ELAINE: He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.
NOREEN: I guess.
ELAINE: I know he belches a lot.
NOREEN: Well, that's something. So, Jerry thought I was flirting with him.
ELAINE: Yeah.
NOREEN: (cutting into a cookie with a knife and fork) Hm. He's kind of a baritone, isn't he?
ELAINE: What are you doing?
NOREEN: I'm eating this cookie.
ELAINE: No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just
think of that?
NOREEN: No, I've seen people do it. I like it.
[George is driving Danny Tartabull to the pledge drive.]
DANNY TARTABULL: This isn't gonna take long, is it?
GEORGE: Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval.
DANNY TARTABULL: I'm sure it's fine.
GEORGE: (swerving) Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger!
DANNY TARTABULL: You sure?
GEORGE: Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!
DANNY TARTABULL: What are you doing?
GEORGE: I'm following him.
New scene.
Nana is at the bank.
Banker: I'm sorry, the account had insufficient funds. We had to return the
checks made out to a Mr. Jerry Seinfeld.
Nana: Oh dear, that's my grandson. May I call him now and explain?
Banker: Oh, certainly.
New scene.
Elaine and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment.
ELAINE: And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is
obsessed, he keeps leaving these annoying messages on my machine.
The phone rings.
JERRY: Would you?
Elaine (answering): Hello?
Nana: Hello, I need to speak to Jerry.
Elaine (thinking it's Dan): Oh, it's you. We were just talking about you.
Listen, Jerry doesn't want to talk to you. Nobody wants to talk to you, so why
don't you just drop dead?
Elaine (hanging up): Heh?
Kramer enters.
KRAMER: Any word from Nana?
JERRY: No.
ELAINE: Nana?
JERRY: Yeah, my grandma's missing.
ELAINE: Missing?
JERRY: Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.
ELAINE: Um, what does Nana sound like?
JERRY: Like a grandmother, why?
ELAINE: Well...
JERRY: Oh, you hung up on my Nana?!
ELAINE: I don't know, maybe.
JERRY: You told Nana to drop dead?!
ELAINE: It's possible.
JERRY: Yes, it is!
KRAMER: Alright, alright. Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS, PDQ.
JERRY: Alright.
New scene.
George is still driving, he's all worked up.
GEORGE: No one gives us the finger! We're Yankees!
DANNY TARTABULL: Want this last donut?
GEORGE: No, you can have it.
(Danny Tartabull begins eating the donut with a knife and fork. George takes notice.)
[Jerry and Kramer are at PBS.]
KRAMER: Jerry, where are all the tote bags?
JERRY: I don't know.
KRAMER: Well, I'm not leaving the premises without tote bags. I was promised tote bags and tote bags I shall have.
KRISTIN: Jerry, this man wants to see you.
JERRY: Leo?
UNCLE LEO: Hello.
JERRY: Uncle Leo! What are you doing here?
UNCLE LEO: I wanted to tell you that your grandmother is fine.
JERRY: Oh.
UNCLE LEO: She's had quite a day but she's gonna watch you tonight on the TV.
KRISTIN: Jerry, I'm dying to meet Danny Tartabull. Where is he?
JERRY: He'll be here any second.
KRISTIN: You know you guys are both on in five minutes.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah.
KRISTIN: (leaving) Okay.
UNCLE LEO: Why didn't you tell me you were a little short? Here. If anybody asks you where you got it, you don't know.
JERRY: No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.
UNCLE LEO: What are you talking about?
JERRY: Please-
UNCLE LEO: I want-
JERRY: It's not necessary.
UNCLE LEO: Jerry, would you please take it.
JERRY: I can't, I can't take it.
UNCLE LEO: I want you to have it!
JERRY: Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!
UNCLE LEO: Jerry, take the money!
JERRY: I don't want it!!
(There's a knock at the door.)
HIGH PITCHED VOICE: Jerry, open up. We need to talk.
KRAMER: Who's that?
JERRY: You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store.
KRAMER: Jerry, I'll take care of it.
(Kramer walks out and sees Dan.)
DAN: Is Jerry in there?
KRAMER: Well, he can't be disturbed now.
DAN: Well this situation is driving me crazy. He's all I think about. I can't get him out of my mind.
KRAMER: I'm sorry. I mean, I know what it's like to be in love. Ties you up in knots. And Jerry is a very sexy man.
DAN: What?
KRAMER: Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco. Before Stonewall about those dark ages when you couldn't come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted because of your, you know.
DAN: No, I don't.
KRISTIN: (running up) Are you Danny Tartabull?
DAN: No, I'm not.
[George is parked at a gas station, he steps out of the car and slams the door.]
GEORGE: I'll take care of this, Danny.
(George approaches the man he's been following, who's now pumping gas.)
GEORGE: Excuse me.
MAN: What's the problem?
GEORGE: I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture.
MAN: I did? Where?
GEORGE: Outside of Manhattan, about an hour ago.
MAN: Wow! Is that Danny Tartabull?
GEORGE: That's right, of the New York Yankees.
MAN: I'd like to shake his hand but I can't.
(The man holds up his arm, it's in a cast with his middle finger sticking straight up.)
[Jerry is doing his bit for PBS.]
JERRY: I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.
[Cut to Nana, watching the pledge drive. She picks up the phone and dials.]
[Cut back to Jerry,]
JERRY: This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-
[Cut to Kramer sitting at the phone bank, his phone rings.]
KRAMER: (answering) PBS pledge drive.
NANA: Hello, I'd like to speak with Jerry.
KRAMER: Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna happen.
NANA: This is his grandmother.
KRAMER: Oh, uh, Nana. Hello.
NANA: Tell Jerry I'm sorry, I'm going to have to write him some new checks.
KRAMER: As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader.
[Cut back to Jerry.]
JERRY: -programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'
(Kramer rises in the background.)
KRAMER: Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.
JERRY: My Nana?
KRAMER: And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars!
(Everybody applauds as Uncle Leo comes out from sidestage.)
UNCLE LEO: She can't do that, she's on a very fixed income! Stop the show!!
[Jerry and Elaine are at the coffee shop.]
JERRY: I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.
ELAINE: Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-
JERRY: Yes, he is.
ELAINE: You should show this to Georgie.
JERRY: Yeah.
WAITRESS: (at the next table) Here's your knife and fork.
JERRY: Look, she's cutting up an Almond Joy.
ELAINE: I just don't get it.
JERRY: You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.
ELAINE: What is wrong with everybody?
JERRY: (surveying the restaurant) Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it!
ELAINE: (standing up) What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!!
[Opening monologue]
I think the thing I admire most about the Chinese is that they're hanging in there with the chopsticks. Because, if you think about it, you know, they've seen the fork... by now. I'm sure they've seen the spoon, they're going, "Yeah, yeah, they're OK... We're going to stay with the sticks." I mean, I don't know how they've missed it: thousands of years ago, Chinese farmer gets up, has his breakfast with the chopsticks, goes out and works all day in the field with a shovel... Hello?... Shovel! Not going out there ploughing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues.
[Day. Jerry and Elaine walking down the street. Elaine is struggling with three grocery bags while Jerry is carrying none. He is pretending not to notice the discrepancy, and keeping his hands busy]
JERRY: (feeling face) Good shave today...
ELAINE: (sarcastic) Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.
JERRY: I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little...
ELAINE: Can we rest here a second.
JERRY: (pause) Yeah, I guess.
(She sits on the stairs of a small entryway)
JERRY: ...So how's Noreen?
ELAINE: Mmm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.
JERRY: Already? That was fast... I assume he's not a High Talker...
ELAINE: No, but... he has... The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.
JERRY: A Long Talker.
ELAINE: Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.
JERRY: (pause) All right; let's move it out.
(Elaine gets her bags and stands up)
JERRY: Hey, isn't that George's father?
(George's father is standing further down the street, talking to a mysterious man in a cape and shades)
ELAINE: Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?
JERRY: I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.
ELAINE: That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?
JERRY: I believe he is wearing a cape.
ELAINE: Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
JERRY: Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.
ELAINE: Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?
JERRY: You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.
(Elaine positions the bags to cover her face. Jerry walks alongside her so he's out of view too)
[Day. Jerry and Elaine arrive at Jerry's apartment]
JERRY: Just, uh, plop it on the counter there.
(Elaine drops one bag deliberately onto the floor and throws the others on the counter -- payback for Jerry not helping with the bags)
JERRY: Oh! I got a message. (presses button on answer machine)
GEORGE: (on tape, lifeless) Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say... (beep)
ELAINE: That sounds urgent...
JERRY: Let me call him back... Hello? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.
ELAINE: Donna Chang?
JERRY: (is redialing) I should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.
ELAINE: Isn't that a little racist?
JERRY: If I like their race, how can that be racist?... Hellooo??... Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!... Yyy-yes, I am calling George... Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!
(Kramer enters. He's got a bottle of water. Jerry stays on the line to chat with Donna)
JERRY: So listen...
KRAMER: Hi. I'm goin' through this stuff like water... (to Jerry) Who you talkin' to? (Jerry waves him away and moves towards the bedroom, still on the phone)
ELAINE: He's on with a Chinese woman.
KRAMER: Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women.
(Kramer appears a little distracted, adjusting his underwear through his pants)
ELAINE: You got a comfort problem there?
KRAMER: No, I think these Jockeys shrunk.
ELAINE: I thought you wore silk underwear.
KRAMER: No, no, n--Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stick with it. No, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. (he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up) My boys need a house!
ELAINE: (not charmed) That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.
KRAMER: Sperm count? Well how many ssssperm should I have?
ELAINE: A lot!
(Jerry comes back, happy)
JERRY: I got a date!
ELAINE: With the Chinese woman?!
JERRY: She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.
KRAMER: Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?
JERRY: No, why should I? I wear boxers.
KRAMER: You ever get a woman pregnant?
JERRY: I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed...
KRAMER: What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?
JERRY: Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??... Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women!
KRAMER: A LOT of 'em! (wild gesture, freaked out) Do you think maybe I'm... Depleted??!!
JERRY: Well, I'm sure you're not... Totally Depleted.
KRAMER: Yeah but what if I am? I'm the last... male Kramer! We're facing extinction!
JERRY: So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.
KRAMER: Yeah, but then I'd have to... (glances at Elaine) well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day??
ELAINE: What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?
(Kramer leaves, disturbed)
ELAINE: (going to the phone) All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.
JERRY: I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!
ELAINE: She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?
JERRY: She suggested it!
ELAINE: I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese...
JERRY: She's very assimilated.
(Elaine's on the phone--we hear a male "Hello?" on the other end. Elaine slams down the phone)
JERRY: Paul again?
ELAINE: (matter of fact) You can't get one ring past him.
(George enters, annoyed)
GEORGE: Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!
JERRY: I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!
GEORGE: ...Huh?
ELAINE: Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.
GEORGE: Hmm, what's he doin' in the city today?
(Elaine and Jerry both shrug)
GEORGE: You didn't ask him?
(They both shake heads no, looking guilty)
GEORGE: (suspicious) You didn't say hello?
ELAINE: Well, he was with someone. A man... In a cape.
GEORGE: Why was he wearing a cape?
(They both shrug)
GEORGE: Was my father wearing a cape?
JERRY: No. Jacket and tie: no cape.
GEORGE: Huh... Cape... (turns, distracted, heads slowly towards door) What was a man with a cape doin' with my father?... What was my father doing with a man in a cape?... (opens door) Why a cape? Hmm! (exits)
[Fertility clinic. Kramer's waiting in an examination room. The Doctor enters]
DOCTOR: The results of your sperm test are in.
KRAMER: Oh?
DOCTOR: Ummm... Are you planning to start a family?
KRAMER: Yes! I would like to very much!... Well, I'm low, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.
KRAMER: Ohhh, maaan!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate--
DOCTOR: Ah--that's not necessarily true.
KRAMER: What
DOCTOR: There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.
KRAMER: All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.
DOCTOR: First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.
KRAMER: All the time?
DOCTOR: All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.
KRAMER: Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.
(Kramer gives the doctor a frustrated look, and his body starts shaking)
[At Elaine's. Elaine's in her robe and talking on the phone, blowing a hair dryer near the phone]
ELAINE: Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!... Oh. She's not?! (hurries to put phone down) Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'-- Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately... Oh, okay, well, look I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna... (a little later, Elaine is sitting and looking very bored) Yeah, I took 20% too... Um. Look it uh... (turns hair dryer on and off) Paul. The... car seems to be running out of gas so... I'm gonna... have to get off the phone. (hangs up)
[Night. The Hunan Balcony. Jerry's in the waiting area, sitting next to a Guy. Jerry's tapping his leg, in a good mood]
HOSTESS: Please let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.
JERRY: Yes, I will.
GUY: (indicating a cigarette) Do you mind?
JERRY: No, go ahead, I second-hand smoke two packs a day.
(Donna Chang enters and walks up to him. She's not Asian. But she is blonde and good-looking)
DONNA: Jerry.
JERRY: (pause. Stops tapping his leg) 'scuse me?
DONNA: Hi. Sorry I'm late.
JERRY: Who are you?
DONNA: I'm Donna Chang...
JERRY: (stands, puzzled, it's not sinking in) W-what do you mean?
DONNA: I mean: I'm Donna Chang.
JERRY: (pause) You're Donna Chang?
DONNA: Did you think I was Chinese?...
JERRY: Oh. No. What, you mean because of the "Chang"?
DONNA: Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.
JERRY: I didn't think so.
DONNA: Used to be "Changstein."
[Day. At Jerry's, Elaine and Jerry. She's making herself a bowl of Raisin Bran]
ELAINE: She's not Chinese?
JERRY: No. Not Chinese. Not even Asian.
ELAINE: So. What is she?
JERRY: Well, she's... like you.
ELAINE: (pause, annoyed) Oh, how disappointed you must have been. (walks to couch, with her cereal)
JERRY: Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang"...
ELAINE: So then why are you seeing her again...
JERRY: Well, she is a woman.
ELAINE: Listen, I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.
JERRY: Really? (sits on couch)
ELAINE: Well, maybe.
JERRY: Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?
ELAINE: (pause) What do you mean?
JERRY: Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?
(As Elaine considers the implications, Kramer comes in. He's got a pile of underwear in his hands)
KRAMER: Here, take my Jockey shorts.
(Jerry and Elaine leap up in horror)
ELAINE: Whoa! Whoa!
JERRY: Here, what is that?!!
KRAMER: Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.
JERRY: Wha--you have a low sperm count?
KRAMER: Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.
JERRY: Nnnoo--I don't want 'em. (starts backing away as Kramer follows him around the room carrying the underwear)
KRAMER: Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!
JERRY: Look! I don't want 'em!
KRAMER: All it takes is one pair! Now, come on! J--
JERRY: I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!
(Kramer's put the pile on Jerry's table and is grabbing at his own pants)
KRAMER: Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!
(Elaine's disgusted and unable to eat her cereal)
KRAMER: What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' CRAZY in these things! (leaves)
JERRY: (re the underwear pile) Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
[Day. At Monk's. George and his father, Frank at a booth]
FRANK: Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.
GEORGE: Plenty of mosquitoes.
FRANK: Queens is full of mosquitoes.
GEORGE: So, Dad...
FRANK: Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.
GEORGE: (pause) Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!
FRANK: (angry) Your mother has to tell you every move I make?!
GEORGE: Jerry and Elaine saw you.
FRANK: They didn't say hello?
GEORGE: Well, they were in a rush.
FRANK: They couldn't just say hello?!... Oh, to hell with them.
GEORGE: They, uh... said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape?...
FRANK: Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--uh, supercilious.
GEORGE: So Dad,--
FRANK: (shouting and clapping hands in anger) How could Jerry not say Hello?!!
(Everyone in diner turns to look)
[Night. Jerry's apartment. Jerry and Donna Chang. She's on the couch and he's drying the dishes. She puts the phone down]
JERRY: Did they uncross the lines yet?
DONNA: No, they can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.
JERRY: (long pause -- did he hear "ridicurous" -- should he say something -- can't decide if he should. Finally...) Did you say, "ridicurous"?
DONNA: Ridiculous.
JERRY: (pause) I thought you said... "ridicurous." (Donna looks puzzled)
(George enters)
GEORGE: Hey-- (spots Donna)
JERRY: Oh, what are you doing here?
GEORGE: Oh, I wanted to talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you... (re Donna) had company. (Jerry indicates he should stay) Hiya, I'm George.
DONNA: Oh! Hi! (they shake hands) I'm Donna Chang. (George to himself registers that as weird. He and Jerry exchange sideways glances) I just spoke to your mother before.
GEORGE: You spoke to my mother?
DONNA: She was trying to call you, but--
JERRY: The rines are crossed?
(They both look at Jerry weirdly)
GEORGE: Did you say, "The rines are crossed?"
JERRY: Did I?
DONNA: (pause) George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
GEORGE: (smile) Yeah.
DONNA: Anyway, I'm really sorry.
GEORGE: Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about?
DONNA: Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.
(Jerry looks shocked. George, calmly as though performing a ritual, goes to the oven, turns on the gas, opens the door and sticks his head inside)
[Night. Jerry's apartment. Jerry and Elaine]
ELAINE: Ay, divorced. That's really too bad...
JERRY: Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.
GEORGE: Oh my God! (coming out of bathroom) You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!
JERRY: Gee, I never thought of that.
GEORGE: Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? (mirthless) Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon!
ELAINE: Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?
JERRY: Have you ever spent any time with these people...?
GEORGE: You know what this has to do with?
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this! I don't trust men in capes.
JERRY: And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.
GEORGE: All right Superman's the exception.
(Elaine looks on in disbelief)
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. (to Jerry) I've always had a thing for Noreen.
ELAINE: No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.
KRAMER: Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. (does a little dance)
JERRY: Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers...
KRAMER: Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.
JERRY: You went back to the Jockeys?
KRAMER: Wrong again.
JERRY: (pause as he realizes) Oh, no.
ELAINE: What? What?...
JERRY: Don't you see what's goin' on here???... No boxers, no Jockeys...
ELAINE: (backing away from Kramer) Eeaawww...
JERRY: The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer, say it isn't so.
KRAMER: Oh, it be so. I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!!
JERRY: Don't you need a little... help?
KRAMER: Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered... (opens door to leave, still very happy, then) Feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!! (exits)
[Day. At Monk's. Elaine and Noreen are sitting at the counter]
ELAINE: So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!...
NOREEN: Yeah, well... We're trying... But he just went insane there for a while...
ELAINE: Oh, he went insane?...
NOREEN: Believe it or not, Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a sick person calls and hangs up over and over?
ELAINE: (awkward, increasingly avoiding eye contact) Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!
NOREEN: (has been growing increasingly slackjawed in amazement) I can't believe that was you...
ELAINE: (looks at Noreen) I'm really sorry, Noreen...
NOREEN: (reconsidering Paul's worth) ...So you thought he was boring?
ELAINE: Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha.
(Elaine makes sweeping upward motion with a fist to accentuate the point)
[Day. Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment]
JERRY: What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!
ELAINE: (head in arms) I know--
JERRY: First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.
ELAINE: Well... I got confused, they sound exactly the same.
JERRY: So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.
ELAINE: (apologetically) I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
JERRY: Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman: anything you say she does!
(Door bell buzzes. Jerry goes over, hits the button)
JERRY: Yeah.
DONNA: It's Donna Chang.
JERRY: (hits button) Come on up. (opens door a little)
ELAINE: Well, I guess I just didn't realize it...
JERRY: Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?
ELAINE: (like a little girl) Okay...
JERRY: First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did.
ELAINE: She was lost...
JERRY: Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did!
ELAINE: Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun...
JERRY: You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...
ELAINE: If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!
(Donna Chang comes in briskly, in a good mood)
DONNA: Hi.
JERRY: Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine...
(At the same time--DONNA: Helllo...--ELAINE: Hi! How are you?)
DONNA: (to Jerry) Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.
ELAINE: (happy gasp) Oh.
JERRY: Why? What happened?
DONNA: Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour and she changed her mind!!!
JERRY: Wow! That's amazing!
DONNA: Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner!
ELAINE: (off camera) Huh.
DONNA: She said you should come too.
JERRY: Tonight?
DONNA: Yeah--I just remembered, I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. (goes to phone)
(Behind her, Jerry and Elaine slowly exchange looks)
[Same day. At the Costanzas' are Frank and Estelle -- George bursts in, frantic. Estelle's snacking, watching TV]
GEORGE: All right. (tearing his jacket off) Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your mind!!!
ESTELLE: (calmly) We're not getting divorced.
FRANK: Your mother changed her mind... (tries to catch a fly with his hand)
GEORGE: (gleeful, to Estelle) You did?! That's Goood! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that.
FRANK: Yeah, we worked it out.
GEORGE: All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?
FRANK: He was my lawyer.
GEORGE: Your lawyer wears a cape...?
FRANK: Yeah. So what?
GEORGE: Who wears a cape?
FRANK: He's very independent; he doesn't follow the trends.
ESTELLE: He looks ridiculous in that thing...
FRANK: (shouting) You have no eye for fashion!!!
ESTELLE: (shouting) I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!
GEORGE: All right! Come on! Let's not fight.
Frank and ESTELLE: All right! All right!
ESTELLE: Georgie's right. (pats him on the cheek)
GEORGE: (quietly) ehh. (pausing to look at both of them) So what made you change your mind?
ESTELLE: It was that Chinese woman.
[Day. In Jerry's car. Jerry's driving, Donna Chang is with him]
JERRY: So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
DONNA: I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.
JERRY: Confucius, huh?
DONNA: Yeah.
JERRY: (pause) You know, you're not Chinese...
[Day. The Costanzas' again. Frank opens the door for Jerry and Donna]
JERRY: Hey! I heard the good news!
FRANK: Jerry, how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!
JERRY: Elaine was... in a rush.
FRANK: (to George, pointing) I knew it was Elaine!!
DONNA: You must be Estelle.
ESTELLE: (giggles) Yes. Who are you...?
DONNA: I'm Donna Chang!
ESTELLE: (steps back, appalled) You're not Chinese!
[Day. In Noreen's apartment. Noreen and Kramer are sitting on the couch when the phone rings. Kramer picks it up. Scene cuts back and forth between Elaine and them]
KRAMER: Y'ello?
ELAINE: Paul?
KRAMER: Elaine!
ELAINE: Kramer?
KRAMER: (pause) YEAHH!
ELAINE: What are you doin' there?
KRAMER: Wellll, isn't it obvious?
ELAINE: (scoffs) Uh, is Noreen there?
KRAMER: Yes she is...
ELAINE: (pause) Well... Can I talk to her?
KRAMER: Oh, what? Am I... tooo boring for you?
ELAINE: (losing patience) Alright--would you just put her on?
KRAMER: Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while...
ELAINE: YOU feel?
KRAMER: That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years...
ELAINE: What, are you insane?!
KRAMER: From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here...
ELAINE: Uh! Ho-ho. An' what are YOU gonna tell her?
KRAMER: Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army...(Noreen sighs a little) There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now... And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do...
ELAINE: (sighs) Kramer! You have GOT to let me talk to her!
KRAMER: Can't help ya, kid.
ELAINE: Get the-- (Kramer puts phone down)
[Day. Back at the Costanzas']
ESTELLE: You're not Chinese!?!?
DONNA: ...No.
ESTELLE: I thought you were Chinese!!
DONNA: I'm from Long Island.
ESTELLE: Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!
DONNA: I'm sorry...?
ESTELLE: Well... then... that changes everything!
GEORGE: What?!
ESTELLE: She's not Chinese; I was duped!!
GEORGE: So what?! She still gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!
ESTELLE: I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! (goes into another room)
GEORGE: (chases after her) Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!
FRANK: (shouts after them) You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!
JERRY: (pause, to Donna) You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name...
[Day. Jerry and Elaine, walking down the street]
ELAINE: So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!
JERRY: Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese. (buys a newspaper out of a machine)
ELAINE: (pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
ELAINE: (quietly) hu_uh, (pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
JERRY: Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish...
(A cab pulls up and George gets out)
GEORGE: Oh, it had to happen!!
JERRY: Hey.
GEORGE: I knew it!! (shuts cab door) I predicted it! (hits cab roof twice, it drives off) Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this! [Kew Gardens (see links at end of script)]
(Kramer sticks his head out of the apartment window, shouts down to them)
KRAMER: (triumphant) Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late! She's laaate!! (give two thumbs up)
[Night on the Brooklyn Bridge. Noreen standing on the the edge, peering over, the wind blowing up on her face -- She starts to outstretch her arms, like a bird about to take flight. Just then, the man in the cape and shades appears. He edges over to her cautiously, reaches over and grabs her forearm, just as she's about to jump....]
NOREEN: (surprised) Who are you?!
MAN: I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. (He starts pulling her to safety)
[Opening Monologue]
The love seat, that's a nice little item, there...I guess some guy thought, 'Well, if we can't get them to sit closer to us, why not just shorten the furniture?' My other favorite furniture brand is the La-Z-Boy. This is very flattering to the prospective customer, isn't it? Why don't we just call it the 'half-conscious deadbeat with no job, home all day, eating Cheetos and watching TV' recliner? I mean, it goes back so far, that thing...I mean, it's like, 'Go to bed already! It's over! You're wiped!'
[Opening scene - Jerry and George in a furniture store. Jerry is shopping for a new couch.]
JERRY: So, she got you to join a book club?
GEORGE: I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.
JERRY: Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits on a couch.) Hey, what about this one?
GEORGE: Nah, I don't like that one.
JERRY: So, what's your first book?
GEORGE: "Breakfast At Tiffany's." 90 pages. (Waves a hand like it's nothing.)
JERRY: It's kinda old, isn't it?
GEORGE: They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.
JERRY (standing): Oh, sure...Truman Capote.
GEORGE: He's a great writer.
JERRY: Oh, yeah.
GEORGE: Did you ever read anything by him?
JERRY: No. You?
GEORGE: Nah.
JERRY (sees a white couch by the wall): Oh, what about this one? Look at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for. (Sits on the couch.) Oh, yeah!
[New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. The moving guys are delivering Jerry's new couch.]
ELAINE: Hey, what's going on?
JERRY: New couch, baby!
ELAINE: New couch? Why?
JERRY: I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.
(Elaine laughs. Carl and another furniture mover come in, and they pick up Jerry's old couch.)
ELAINE (to Carl, flirtatiously): Hello.
CARL: Hello.
ELAINE: Oh, let me get the door for you. (They carry the couch out the door.) Ooh, be careful!
JERRY: Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.
ELAINE: What are you doing with your old couch?
JERRY: Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?
ELAINE: Yeah, I'll take it.
JERRY: Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.
ELAINE: Yes, they can. (Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: Hey! Couch is comin.'
JERRY: It's here!
KRAMER: Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch.
JERRY (nonplussed): Yeah. So do I.
KRAMER: Ooh! Remember Poppie?
JERRY: Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant?
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?
JERRY: Yeah.
ELAINE: What was that again?
KRAMER: It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?
ELAINE (in a southern accent): Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!
JERRY: What made you resurrect that old idea?
KRAMER: Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the "old" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.
ELAINE: I heard Poppie's was good, let's go.
JERRY: I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?
KRAMER: That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.
ELAINE: Ooh! I love duck. C'mon, c'mon!
KRAMER: Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.
JERRY: Oh, Kramer, I -
(Kramer turns around and runs smack into Jerry's new couch being brought in by Carl and the other moving guy, and hits the floor. They place the couch in the same spot as the old one.)
JERRY: Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?
ELAINE: Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.
JERRY: Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.
CARL (hands Jerry an invoice): Sign here.
ELAINE (to Carl): Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far.
CARL: Sure.
ELAINE: 'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?
CARL: Yeah, I think we can squeeze you in.
ELAINE: Oh, goody. Okay, well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...I'll see you chumps later. (Elaine and Carl exit.)
KRAMER: Did you offer those guys a drink?
JERRY: Uh, no. Should I have?
KRAMER: What kind of a person are you?
JERRY: I don't know.
[New scene - George at home, preparing to read "Breakfast At Tiffany's."]
GEORGE: Okay. "Breakfast At Tiffany's." (Begins to read, but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. George realizes there's a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, and doesn't start the book.)
[New scene - Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's Restaurant.]
ELAINE: So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, "Do you date moving men?"
JERRY: Ah ha...
ELAINE: You wanna know what I said?
JERRY: I can't wait.
ELAINE: "I do now."
JERRY: Clever.
ELAINE: Is that something?
JERRY: Yes.
ELAINE: Is that something?
JERRY: You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.
ELAINE: Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.
JERRY: So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?
ELAINE: Yes.
JERRY: Well, would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.)
POPPIE: Hello! Jerry, so good to see you again! (Puts his hand out.)
JERRY (clearly creeped out by having to shake Poppie's hand): Hello, Poppie. This is Elaine.
ELAINE: Nice to meet you, Poppie.
POPPIE: Let me show you to your table. (Leads Jerry and Elaine to the table.) Your duck is cooking as we speak. It is so succulent...so succulent!
JERRY: Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.
POPPIE: Your friend and I are going to make a lot of money. Of course, I already have a lot of money. Poppie does very well...very well.
ELAINE: Well, your mother must be very proud of you.
POPPIE: My mother...was taken from my house by the Communists in the middle of the night when I was ten years old. She was sent to a slave labor camp, where she labored for twelve years. Finally, they released her and she was on a boat to America to re-unite with us...but she was served some bad fish, and she died...on the high seas.
JERRY: So, what's good tonight?
[Cut back to George at home. His television program finishes, and he turns off the TV. He stretches, then goes back to reading - not "Breakfast At Tiffany's" however, but an issue of Cracked magazine.]
[Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.]
ELAINE: Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.
JERRY: Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.
ELAINE: Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.
JERRY: Why not?
ELAINE: Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.
JERRY: So, you won't eat the pizza?
ELAINE: No way.
JERRY: Really.
ELAINE: Yeah.
JERRY: Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?
ELAINE: Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.
JERRY: Really!
ELAINE: Yeah. That's right.
JERRY: Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.)
POPPIE: Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck...it is more succulent than even I had hoped.
JERRY: Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?
POPPIE: When my mother was abducted by the Communists, she was with child...
JERRY: Oh, boy.
POPPIE: ...but the Communists, they put an end to that! So, on this issue there is no debate! And no intelligent person can think differently.
ELAINE (offended): Well...Poppie. I think differently.
POPPIE: And what gives you the right to do that?
ELAINE (standing up): The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon.
WOMAN AT NEXT TABLE (to her date): I heard that. Let's go, Henry.
HENRY: But we just got here...
WOMAN AT ANOTHER TABLE: I'm with you, Poppie!
WOMAN AT YET ANOTHER TABLE (to her date): Let's go!
ELAINE (to Poppie): And I am not coming back!
POPPIE: You're not welcome!
JERRY: Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.)
[New scene - Jerry and George in a booth at the coffee shop.]
JERRY: Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.
GEORGE: I'm sorry I missed it.
JERRY: Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (Jerry smiles. George laughs.) So, how's the book coming? (George's laughs taper off...) I say, how's the book comin'?
GEORGE: Oh...pretty good.
JERRY: So, what's it about?
GEORGE: Well, it's about Holly Go-Lightly.
JERRY: Holly Go-Lightly.
GEORGE: Yeah, she's quite a character.
JERRY: Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?
GEORGE: No.
JERRY: Big surprise.
GEORGE: I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.
JERRY: You're not very bright, are you?
GEORGE: No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days.
JERRY: Why don't you rent the movie?
GEORGE: 'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved. (Kramer enters and comes over to the booth.)
KRAMER (scanning a menu): So...how was the dinner last night?
JERRY: Oh...well...
KRAMER: Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.
ELAINE (sitting down): Oh...well...
KRAMER: Alright, what did you do to Poppie?
ELAINE: Nothing.
KRAMER: Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.
ELAINE: What's wrong with him?
KRAMER: I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.)
JERRY: We should get him something.
ELAINE: Yeah. You're right.
[New scene - Elaine and Carl sitting in carl's moving van after a date.]
ELAINE: Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation?
CARL: Not much! (They both laugh.) I, uh, would have invited you up, but I don't have any furniture.
ELAINE: You don't have any furniture?
CARL: No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it. (They laugh again.)
ELAINE: Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?
CARL: Yeah! No heavy lifting. (Elaine and Carl look into each others eyes, then kiss.)
[New scene - Kramer visiting Poppie at the hospital. There sitting on a bench outside.]
KRAMER: Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.
POPPIE (opening the gift basket): What's this? A bottle of wine and a five-alarm chili? They're trying to kill Poppie?!
KRAMER: Why, what...?
POPPIE: Don't they know I have a gastro-intestinal disorder? If I would have any of this, I would die. Then Poppie's no good to anyone! This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie. How could you be friends with those two?
KRAMER: Well, we're not very close.
POPPIE: They owe me for those ducks. They were flown in from Newfoundland.
KRAMER: Oh, they got good ducks there, huh?
POPPIE: Oh, very good ducks.
[New scene - Elaine shows up at Jerry's apartment. Jerry opens the door.]
ELAINE: I'm in looove!
JERRY: Whoa!
ELAINE: This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!
JERRY: Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?
ELAINE: No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.)
JERRY: No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?
ELAINE (putting on lipstick): Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity.
JERRY: Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?
ELAINE (looks at Jerry and smears lipstick across her face): What?
JERRY: What is his stand...on abortion?
ELAINE: Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice.
JERRY: How do you know?
ELAINE: Because he, well...he's just so good-looking.
JERRY: Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.
[New scene - George at a video store counter.]
GEORGE: I'd like to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's.
CLERK (checking the computer): Uh, this is out. Someone has it.
GEORGE: Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it.
CLERK: Well, I could put it on reserve for you, if you'd like.
GEORGE: Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.
CLERK: Oh, sorry. We can't do that.
GEORGE: Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.
CLERK: I don't think so. It doesn't work that way.
(The clerk goes to help another customer, and leaves George unattended. George waits until the clerk's back is turned, then has a good look at the information on his computer monitor.)
[New scene - George at the address of the people who have rented Breakfast At Tiffany's. He's buzzed their apartment on the intercom.]
VOICE ON INTERCOM: Yes?
GEORGE: Uh, excuse me, are you Joe Temple?
INTERCOM: Yes.
GEORGE: Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's?
[New scene - Jerry laying on his new couch. Kramer enters.]
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: Hey, what's happenin.'
KRAMER: Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.
JERRY: You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.
KRAMER: Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.)
JERRY: Okay. Hi, Poppie.
POPPIE: Hello.
JERRY: I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.
POPPIE: That's fine. If you just give me my duck money, I'll be on my way.
JERRY: Okay. I'll get it. (Goes into the bedroom.)
KRAMER: Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. (Poppie moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) What, are you tired, Poppie?
POPPIE: No.
KRAMER: Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?
POPPIE: Kramer, did I ever tell you about my mother? My mother -
JERRY (comes out of the bedroom with Poppie's money): Here you go. (Poppie stands up and takes the money.) Anyway, I'm sorry again about the...(notices a large, wet stain on his couch)...the...the...
POPPIE: The what? (Looks at Kramer, and exits.)
JERRY: ...the...the...
KRAMER (to Poppie): So long. I'll see you tonight.
JERRY (frantic): Kramer, Kramer, what is this?!
KRAMER: What is what?
JERRY: This puddle on my sofa!
KRAMER: What puddle?
JERRY (points): That puddle! (Kramer sees the puddle and does a double-take.)
KRAMER: I don't know.
JERRY (looking at the puddle with Kramer): Is it...? Could it...? Could he have...? IT IS! (Grabs Kramer.) Poppie peed on my sofa!!
KRAMER: Are you sure?
JERRY: Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!
KRAMER: I'm sure it'll come out.
JERRY: I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!
KRAMER: Ah, you're making too much of it.
JERRY (sarcastic): Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be.
KRAMER: Right!
[New scene - George at Joe Temple's door.]
GEORGE: Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.
JOE: Well, I was going to watch it with my daughter. She likes Audrey Hepburn very much.
GEORGE: She was a delicate flower.
JOE: Why didn't you just read the book?
GEORGE: Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... (Joe's daughter comes to the door.)
JOE: Remy, this is George. Would you mind if he watched Breakfast At Tiffany's with us? (George smiles at Remy. Remy looks at Joe doubtfully.)
[New scene - Elaine climbs into the cab of Carl's moving van.]
CARL: Hi.
ELAINE: Hi. (They kiss.)
CARL: I missed you.
ELAINE: Oh, I missed you!
CARL: I don't remember the last time I felt this way.
ELAINE: Me, either!
CARL: I think about you all the time.
ELAINE: You do?
CARL: Do you think about me?
ELAINE: Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.
CARL: What friend?
ELAINE: Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carl's response will be.)
CARL: You know, someday...we're going to get enough people in the Supreme Court to change that law.
(Elaine breaks down in tears.)
[New scene - George sitting on Joe's couch, about to watch Breakfast At Tiffany's with Joe and Remy.]
GEORGE: So, anything to uh, nosh?
JOE: What did you want?
GEORGE: Popcorn?
REMY: Popcorn? Where do you think you are?
GEORGE: Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.
REMY: Well, we don't.
GEORGE: You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.
JOE (passes George a bowl): Here's some nuts.
GEORGE: Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.
REMY (to Joe): Can we watch the movie now, Daddy? (Joe presses play on the remote.)
GEORGE: Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'
JOE: The lights are fine. (George shrugs, and the movie begins.)
[New scene - Kramer and Poppie in the kitchen of the restaurant, making the first 'test pizza.']
KRAMER (in a chef's hat and apron): See, anybody can do this. (Tosses pizza dough into the air.)
POPPIE: Use your wrist! It's all in the wrist. (Kramer tosses the dough way up there.) Not too high!
KRAMER (puts the dough on the counter): Alright, put a little sauce on here... (speaks some unintelligible words in an Italian accent while spreading the sauce around.) Some cheese...
POPPIE: Not too much!
KRAMER: And...cucumbers! (Grabs a large handful and puts them on the pizza.)
POPPIE: Wait a second...what is that?
KRAMER: It's cucumbers.
POPPIE: No, no. You can't put cucumbers on a pizza.
KRAMER: Well, why not? I like cucumbers.
POPPIE: That's not a pizza. It'll taste terrible.
KRAMER: But that's the idea, you make your own pie.
POPPIE: Yes, but we cannot give the people the right to choose any topping they want! Now on this issue there can be no debate!
KRAMER: What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?
POPPIE: Because it's a pizza!
KRAMER: It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!
POPPIE: It's a pizza the moment you put your fists in the dough!
KRAMER: No, it isn't!
POPPIE: Yes, it is!
[Cut back to George, Joe and Remy watching the movie. Joe's wife enters.]
JOE'S WIFE: I'm home.
JOE: Hey, honey.
REMY: Hi, Mom.
JOE'S WIFE: Hi, baby. (To George.) Hello. Breakfast At Tiffany's?
JOE: Yeah.
JOE'S WIFE: Well, I just came back from Angela's, it's not looking very good for Duncan.
JOE: Aw, that's too bad.
JOE'S WIFE: Yeah, the doctor thinks it's just a matter of time -
GEORGE (clears his throat, annoyed that the movie's being interrupted): Joe...could you...
JOE'S WIFE: Poor guy, I hate to see him suffer like this...
GEORGE: You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.
JOE'S WIFE: Who are you?
JOE: This is George Costanza.
GEORGE (irritated): This is very hard to follow with all the talking.
JOE: I'll pause it, okay? (Pauses the tape with the remote.)
GEORGE: Any more grape juice? (Gets up and goes to the kitchen. Remy moves to the end of the couch where George was sitting.)
JOE'S WIFE: Who is this guy?
REMY: He's in some book club.
JOE'S WIFE: And what's he doing here?
REMY: Cheating on his test. (George returns from the kitchen with a glass of grape juice.)
GEORGE: So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? (Joe's wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. George gestures to Remy to move.) Okay, c'mon. Let's go.
REMY: What?
GEORGE: C'mon, you took my seat.
REMY: It's not your seat.
GEORGE: I was sitting there, c'mon.
REMY: You didn't save it.
GEORGE: I had the arm! Joe...
JOE: What's the difference?
GEORGE: Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here...
REMY: It's my couch.
GEORGE: Alright, c'mon, scooch over. (Tries to squeeze into the corner seat of the couch and struggles with Remy. He spills his glass of grape juice all over the couch in the process.)
REMY: Look! Look what you did! You got grape juice all over our couch, you've ruined our couch! (Joe slowly walks toward George with his hands on his hips.)
GEORGE: Joe...
[New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment the next day, looking at the "Poppie-stain" on Jerry's sofa.]
ELAINE: Oh my god.
JERRY: You see?!
ELAINE: So, you're gonna get a new couch?
JERRY: Well, I guess I have no choice.
ELAINE: Do you want your old couch back?
JERRY: I was hoping you'd offer. (The intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
INTERCOM: It's the movers.
JERRY: 'Kay. (Buzzes them in.)
ELAINE: Who's that?
JERRY: Your boyfriend, he's taking it out.
ELAINE: No, no, he's not my boyfriend.
JERRY: Why?
ELAINE: Take a guess.
JERRY: Oh, really. (Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.)
ELAINE: Hi.
CARL: Hi.
JERRY: Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.
CARL: Today?
JERRY: Could you?
CARL: Sure.
ELAINE (to Jerry): What are you doing with this couch?
JERRY: George is taking it.
ELAINE: Did you tell him it was peed on?
JERRY: He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.
[New scene - Elaine and Carl in Elaine's kitchen.]
CARL: I'm sorry you feel that way, Elaine.
ELAINE: Yeah, me too.
CARL: It's just too bad.
ELAINE: Yeah. It is.
CARL: Well, I better get this couch back to Jerry's.
ELAINE: Can I offer you anything to drink?
CARL (off-camera): Yeah, sure.
ELAINE (looking in the fridge): All I've got is grape juice.
CARL: Throw it!
(Elaine heaves the grape juice bottle over-hand at Carl, and we hear the sound of breaking glass.)
CARL: The couch!
[New scene - George sitting in with the book club around a back booth at Monk's.]
MARIE (describing Holly Go-Lightly in "Breakfast At Tiffany's"): She didn't want the constraints of any relationship, that's why she got rid of the cat. The most important thing in Holly's life was her independence.
GEORGE: Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.
MARIE: George...Fred's gay.
(George ponders this quizzically.)
[Nightclub]
JERRY: I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? "Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!"
[Jerry's apartment]
JERRY: I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" thing.
GEORGE: I think she finds my stupidity charming.
JERRY: As we all do.
GEORGE: Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.
JERRY: Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?
GEORGE: Yeah, I'll zip in, "How do you do?", zip out. She'll love me.
JERRY: You're good with the mothers.
GEORGE: Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.
JERRY: Maybe you should date the mothers.
GEORGE: Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.
JERRY: Oh, you got something goin'.
GEORGE: Yeah.
KRAMER: (enters apartment) Hey.
GEORGE: Hey! (heads toward bathroom)
KRAMER: Hey, you got a hammer?
JERRY: What do you need a hammer for?
KRAMER: Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em.
JERRY: Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.
KRAMER: No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?
JERRY: Nah, I don't think so.
KRAMER: (shouting to the bathroom door) George, you wanna go for a ride?
GEORGE: (inside bathroom) Nah.
KRAMER: Oh, COME ON!
JERRY: Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?
KRAMER: All right, I've had it with you two. (opens apartment door to leave)
JERRY: Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?
KRAMER: A gymnast!
JERRY: Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.
KRAMER: A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face.
JERRY: Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.
KRAMER: (shuts door) "Bailing"?
JERRY: Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.
KRAMER: Jerry, you should pay that price.
JERRY: She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?
KRAMER: Ch- oo-... what?
GEORGE: (emerging from bathroom, buttoning his shirt) A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.
JERRY: (watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this?
GEORGE: What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on.
JERRY: (stares at George, incredulous) "Back on"? What was it doing off?
GEORGE: I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the "office".
JERRY: (laughing) What for?
GEORGE: Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances.
JERRY: Unbuttoned, or all the way off?
GEORGE: ALL the way, baby!
JERRY: Of course.
KRAMER: (convulses in pain) Yeow! Whoa.
JERRY: What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.
KRAMER: (exiting apartment) Yeah, yeah, yeah...
JERRY: (picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt off?
GEORGE: Always.
JERRY: Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.
[Mr. Pitt's office]
MR. PITT: Elaine, I need you to proofread this report for my meeting with the Poland Creek Bottled Water people.
ELAINE: What meeting?
MR. PITT: I told you. I sit on the Board of Trustees for Morgan Springs, and we're trying to acquire Poland Creek.
ELAINE: Oh! (tries to take paper)
MR. PITT: (pulls away) Are you using a fountain pen?
ELAINE: Yes?
MR. PITT: They smear! Under no circumstances is ink to be used in this office.
ELAINE: All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.
(knock at door)
KRAMER: Elaine?
ELAINE: Come in, come in!
KRAMER: Yeah. (enters, points at package) Yah, huh?
ELAINE: Ah, right there, yeah.
KRAMER: (rips open package) Yeah, that's...
ELAINE: Kramer, it's...
KRAMER: (holds up framed picture): There she blows! (throws paper around)
ELAINE: Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?
KRAMER: Oh, these are nice corners, huh?
MR. PITT: Elaine, did I hear... (sees Kramer) Oh, this is very odd.
KRAMER: (looking at picture) Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. BIG computers.
MR. PITT: Yes, I've heard about these. How do they work?
KRAMER: Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... (Kramer and Pitt stare at picture) Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!
MR. PITT: I don't see it.
KRAMER: Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...
MR. PITT: I still don't see it.
ELAINE: Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.
KRAMER: Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you.
MR. PITT: A spaceship, where?
KRAMER: (pointing) Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. (convulses in pain) Waahh! Oh, mama!
ELAINE: Kramer, what's wrong?
KRAMER: Mama!
ELAINE: Kramer, Kramer, are you okay?
KRAMER: I think I gotta go to the doctor! (exits) Oh, mama!
MR. PITT: (still staring at picture) How long does it usually take?
[Lindsay's mother's apartment]
(Lindsay's relatives are laughing, and George has apparently been witty and charming)
MRS. ENRIGHT: Oh, George, it is so nice to finally meet you. And I'm sorry we've kept Lindsay so long.
LINDSAY: Mother...
GEORGE: Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.
MRS. ENRIGHT: Oh? Are you and your family close?
GEORGE: (hesitates) Very close, yes. Almost painfully close.
LINDSAY: Mother, I'm going to walk Nana and Aunt Phyllis to the elevator. George, do you mind waiting just one more minute?
GEORGE: Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! (shakes hands with Nana) Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA! (embraces another guest, kisses her) Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?
MRS. ENRIGHT: Can I offer you anything to eat?
GEORGE: Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?
MRS. ENRIGHT: Oh no, George, you don't have to...
GEORGE: No, I know I don't have to, I want to.
MRS. ENRIGHT: George, you are such a gentleman.
GEORGE: I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. (exits) Here we go, all right.
[Kitchen]
(George opens trash bin, sees an éclair at the top with one bite taken out of it. After looking around to make sure no one is watching, he picks up the éclair and takes a bite just as Mrs. Enright enters the kitchen.)
MRS. ENRIGHT: (wide-eyed) Oh...
GEORGE: (spits out mouthful of food): Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
[Mr. Pitt's office]
ELAINE: (pointing at 3-D picture) Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!
MR. PITT: Where is it?
ELAINE: (pointing) Right here.
MR. PITT: I'm looking there!
ELAINE: No, no, unfocus.
MR. PITT: I am unfocused!
(phone rings)
ELAINE: (answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.
MR. PITT: (still staring at picture) Meeting?
ELAINE: Yeah, the Poland Creek merger?
MR. PITT: Why don't you go for me?
ELAINE: How can I go?
MR. PITT: Oh, all they're gonna do is read the report.
ELAINE: Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.
MR. PITT: Oh, DAMN this thing!
[Jerry's car]
JERRY: (trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.
KATYA: Oh yes. He was not shy about dictating.
JERRY: He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. "I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"
KATYA: And you could not refuse.
JERRY: No, you'd have to be crazy.
KATYA: He was a very bad dictator.
JERRY: Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad.
[Monk's Diner]
JERRY: So lemme get this straight: you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an éclair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, "What the hell, I'll just eat some trash."
GEORGE: No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!
JERRY: Was it in the trash?
GEORGE: Yes.
JERRY: Then it was trash.
GEORGE: It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.
JERRY: But it was in the cylinder!
GEORGE: Above the rim.
JERRY: Adjacent to refuse, is refuse.
GEORGE: It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.
JERRY: Was it eaten?
GEORGE: One little bite.
JERRY: Well, that's garbage.
GEORGE: But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!
JERRY: Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum.
(Kramer enters, walking awkwardly)
JERRY: Hey!
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: What's with you?
KRAMER: I got a stone.
JERRY: What stone?
KRAMER: A kidney stone.
JERRY: What is that, anyway?
KRAMER: It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!
JERRY: Oh, that's gotta hurt.
[Poland Creek office]
ARONSON: Our shareholders have given basic approval for the merger, including the stock swap.
ELAINE: Ah. The "stock swap". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)
BECK: And if you'll just give this to Mr. Pitt, and tell him we expect to be in full-scale production by the spring.
ELAINE: All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?
BECK: Moland Spring.
ELAINE: (making a face) "Moland"?
ARONSON: Yes, we combined Morgan and Poland.
ELAINE: Yeah, I know, but... "Moland"? I wouldn't drink anything called "Moland".
ARONSON: But it was Mr. Pitt's idea.
ELAINE: Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?
ARONSON: (to Beck) We've got to do something about that name.
[Jerry's apartment]
GEORGE: (on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.
JERRY: Good for you.
GEORGE: Yes, good for me!
JERRY: Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.
GEORGE: Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!
KRAMER: (enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into VCR, sets up TV)
JERRY: Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.
KRAMER: Jerry, what is your problem?
JERRY: Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.
KRAMER: All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?
JERRY: No.
KRAMER: Tantric yoga?
JERRY: No.
KRAMER: Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!
JERRY: Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's better than eating it.
KRAMER: All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts playback)
JERRY: All right.
GEORGE: Did you pass your stone yet?
KRAMER: Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.
JERRY: (pointing at TV) Hey, that's her!
KRAMER: Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes.
[Jerry's car, night]
